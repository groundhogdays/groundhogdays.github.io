        <h2><strong>how has groundhog day evolved groundhog day family review</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Due to a lack of hedgehogs, the settlers began using another hibernating mammal: The groundhog. The day eventually evolved into what we know it today. In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for  
This reliance on celestial cues evolved into traditions captured by holidays that have survived to this day.  Groundhog Day isn’t the only cross-quarter holiday that has stuck to the modern  
The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring. DamianKuzdak/Getty Images Places like Missouri, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
Groundhog Day fans aren’t able to arrive at the official “Gobbler’s Knob” grounds until they open at 3 a.m. ET. Since the holiday has evolved over time, Groundhog Day activities don’t just end after Phil makes his predictions. In fact, celebratory events continue throughout the rest of the week — including the Groundhog Ball on Feb. 3. 
Groundhog Day has evolved into a full-fledged festival, with parades, parties, and events celebrating local culture and heritage. Towns across the United States and Canada have adopted their own versions of the tradition, with groundhogs like Staten Island Chuck in New York and Wiarton Willie in Ontario offering their predictions. 
Move over local television and radio meteorologists. Come February 2, a different weather expert garners all the forecasting glory. Groundhog Day is a lighthearted tradition that millions of people enjoy each February, and the custom may have much older roots than celebrants realize. 
Groundhog Day – the holiday, not the 1993 Bill Murray movie — evolved from Candlemas Day, a Christian holy day commemorating the purification of the Virgin Mary. 
Thanks to a small town in northern Illinois, Groundhog Day is bigger than one chubby rodent and its shadow dropping a dubious weather forecast. In Woodstock, the groundhog takes a backseat to the real cause for celebration: the 1993 Bill Murray movie that was filmed there. WNIJ’s Under Rocks team visited the famed town square with the head of the annual festival (and Groundhog Day movie  
On Feb. 2, while many Americans “celebrate” Groundhog Day, most of them will most-likely being doing so without recognizing the (somewhat loose) connection that the holiday has with Christianity. What is this connection? Well I’m so glad you asked, otherwise the 45 minutes I spent Googling this up would have been wasted. 
Call it a Groundhog Day déjà vu. For the fifth year in a row, a New Jersey borough has had to cancel its beloved Groundhog Day celebration for a simple, and pretty important, reason: They can  
10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13. When does a groundhog come before a woodchuck? In the dictionary. 
Groundhog Day evolved from religious and secular traditions aimed at providing hope amidst unpredictability. Despite technological advances, psychologically, we are still beholden to forces  
In Iowa, we have Polk County Paula. Since 2004, the High Life Lounge has hosted the costumed groundhog as part of its annual celebration.. Like Punxsutawney Phil, Polk County Paula will search for  </p>
