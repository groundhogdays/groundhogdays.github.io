        <h2><strong>recent movie like groundhog day emoji for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
Why you'll like this movie: Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. Premise: 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
The classic 1993 movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a surly weatherman sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the tiny town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil (who openly  
You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life. 
The definitive movie about time loops, Groundhog Day, has become a beloved, cherished, and fan-favorite comedy since it was released in the early '90s. It's also regarded as one of the best  
You know a movie is special when people describe it as “Groundhog Day” crossed with something you’d never expect. Here are a handful of films that were inspired by or informed a similar  
Since the premise of the movie is nothing new and a lot of movies have been made on that premise, we decided to make a list of movies that are similar or are based on a similar time-loop kind of a premise. We hope you enjoy the list and find a decent movie to watch. Here is the list of the 10 best movies like Groundhog Day. Primer 
Bill Murray repeating the same day over and over is certainly unique, but here are 12 movies like "Groundhog Day" we think you should check out. 
Office worker Barry Thomas is forced to relive the worst day of his life. [11] Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over. [12] This movie is generally seen as the quintessential time-loop movie by many with its name being synonymous with the genre as a whole. 
Not exactly about reliving a day, but time travel: Timecrimes (2007). It's not wholesome tho. Also Predestination (2014), about time travel Edit: Source Code (2011)! This one actually does have the "repete the same event" formula. All of these are more action/sci-fi, not about life lessons like Groundhog Day 
Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time.

New. Controversial. Old. Q&amp;A.  Happy Death Day. Well, it's not a concept "like" Groundhog Day, it's a concept exactly the same as Groundhog Day.  Movies Like  
New Line Television “12:01” (1993) • The short story on which “12:01” is based actually pre-dates “Groundhog Day” by nearly 20 years.It’s about a man caught reliving the worst day

"Groundhog Day" was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year, garnering over $105 million at the box office. It also won the BAFTA Award for best original screenplay. The movie is available  
If, like the rest of us, you watched the trailer and believed that this was going to be a mere Groundhog Day rip-off featuring that obnoxious guy from Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you too would be dead wrong. 
Andy Samberg becomes the latest “Saturday Night Live” alum to explore movie stardom with “Palm Springs,” a romantic comedy co-starring Cristin Milioti. If that career arc sounds familiar  </p>
