        <p>The award-winning and record-breaking Groundhog Day The Musical will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne early next year. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, Groundhog Day The Musical will play exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre, for a strictly limited season from January 24th, 2024. 
A stellar cast has been announced for the award-winning and record-breaking Groundhog Day The Musical which will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne early next year. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, Groundhog Day The Musical will play exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre, for a strictly limited  
Groundhog Day the Musical has ended it’s 13-week season at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Phil Connors, a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Caught in a time loop, he’s forced to relive the same day again and again and again. 
Tim Minchin, known for his work on ‘Matilda The Musical’, wrote the music and lyrics for ‘Groundhog Day The Musical’. The adaptation keeps the essence of the original film while weaving in new, musically-driven narratives that bring a fresh perspective and depth to the story. 
What you may not know, however, is that since 2016 it’s also served as a stage musical – co-created by the film’s original writer Danny Rubin with Australia’s own Tim Minchin.’ 
“Melbourne will be the only place people will be able to see Groundhog Day The Musical, and only the third city in the world to stage the production – a genuine coup for Australia’s theatre capital,” Minister for Tourism, Sport and Major Events Steve Dimopoulos said. 
The blockbuster musical Groundhog Day The Musical is set to make its Australian premiere at Melbourne’s iconic Princess Theatre in January 2024, where it will run for an exclusive season. This is the first time the production will have been staged outside of London and New York. 
It's Groundhog Day The Musical — and it's finally making its way to the Australian stages ten years after it was first announced. Back in 2014, Australian comedian, musician, actor and writer Tim Minchin revealed that he was making a song-filled onstage version of the Bill Murray-starring classic comedy. Then, the end result premiered in  
His award-winning production, Groundhog Day the Musical, will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne in January, 2024. Minchin joined Sammy J to discuss what makes his adaptation of the famous  
This reinterpretation of the hilarious 1993 film, Groundhog Day, is led by Australian singer-songwriter Tim Minchin. Follow Phil Connors, a Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in a small Pennsylvanian town. He becomes trapped in a time loop, and is forced to relieve the day over and over again. 
Matthew Warchus: “Groundhog Day is one of my all-time favourite films and making the musical stage adaptation with Danny Rubin and Tim Minchin was one of the happiest creative experiences of my life. With echoes of classics such as The Music Man and It’s A Wonderful Life, the Groundhog Day film manages to be both a great screwball comedy  
The setlist will be fluid and the shows will have more of an unplanned intimate ‘evening with’ vibe as Tim chats about his song writing and perform songs drawn from his 2020 studio album, Apart Together, his musicals, Matilda and Groundhog Day, his TV and film writing and from his early songwriting days in the late 20th century. 
The award-winning and record-breaking Groundhog Day The Musical will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne early next year.. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, Groundhog Day The Musical will play exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre, for a strictly limited season from January 24th, 2024.
