        <h2><strong>what year was groundhog day made the start of groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day (Pennsylvania German: Grund'sau dåk, Grundsaudaag, Grundsow Dawg, Murmeltiertag; Nova Scotia: Daks Day) [1] [2] [3] is a tradition observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
On February 2, 1887, Groundhog Day, featuring a rodent meteorologist, is celebrated for the first time at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.According to tradition, if a groundhog  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
In the 1880s, Clymer H. Freas, the editor of the Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper, had the idea to make Groundhog Day a formal holiday, and naming Punxsutawney Phil as the official weather-predicting groundhog. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, established in 1887, carries on the tradition today. While other cities have similar celebrations, there  
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
The "Punxsutawney Groundhog Club" was founded in 1886 by a group of groundhog hunters, one of whom was the editor of the town's newspaper and quickly published a proclamation about its local weather prognosticating groundhog (though Phil didn't get his name until 1961). The first Gobbler's Knob ceremony took place the next year, and the rest is  
What is Groundhog Day? Groundhog Day is a tradition that has taken place annually in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since Feb. 2, 1987. A groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, is brought  
Let’s be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray’s comedic performance as Phil Connors, the grumpy weatherman trapped in a time loop, has become a classic.

Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
Punxsutawney Phil is reportedly 139 years old, which is 1,251 years old in human years. But Punxsutawney Phil is no average groundhog , and he has access to a special brew that helps prolong his life. 
Groundhog Day is celebrated annually, and it’s always on Feb. 2.  If you can’t make it in person to this year’s Groundhog Day celebration, you can catch it on live stream via the Zoo’s  
The Legacy of "Groundhog Day" (1993) The popularity of Groundhog Day skyrocketed in 1993 with the release of the movie "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again in Punxsutawney.

Every February 2, on Groundhog Day, Willie takes part in the local Wiarton Willie Festival. His role is to predict whether there will be an early spring.
