Jeep's Extended Bill Murray 'Groundhog Day' Super Bowl Ad And Behind The Scenes Footage From The Production Of The Commercial.Bill Murray agreed to reprise t 
This was the challenge that Francois faced when his team first came up with the idea for its 60-second Super Bowl commercial, a brilliant reprise of "Groundhog Day" that finished first in USA  
Check out the Jeep ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù extended Super Bowl 2020 commercial with Bill Murray!  Jeep ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù Super Bowl Commercial 2020 with Bill Murray  
It was d√©j√† vu all over again. For Super Bowl LIV, Jeep rolled out a commercial starring Bill Murray reprising his role as TV weatherman Phil Connors from the beloved 1993 film ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚Äù 
Persuading Murray to reprise his role came down to a chance meeting, a lengthy letter and surprise call two weeks before the game. 
Jeep: Groundhog Day: Directed by Jim Jenkins. With Justin Campbell, Brian Doyle-Murray, Kevin Lingle, Bill Murray. In Jeep's Super Bowl commercial: Bill Murray and other original Groundhog's Day cast members reenact scenes from the movie, only the Bill's character now uses a Jeep to go on outings with the ground hog. 
It‚Äôs Groundhog Day‚Äì but in 2020, this yearly event took place on a date that turned out to anything but the norm. Recognizing that, Jeep hit it out of the park. The automobile company realized that in a rare feat, kind of like getting ahold of legendary comedian Bill Murray, the holiday fell on Super Bowl Sunday. 
Now, Bill Murray has stepped up to revisit his iconic role from Harold Ramis‚Äô 1993 comedy classic, ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚Äù This Super Bowl ad for Jeep features Murray reprising Phil Connors  
Emmy-nominated Jeep Super Bowl spot from Chicago Agency High Dive.

Jeep's 2020 Gladiator doesn't look like anything else, so it's logical that a Super Bowl commercial would have the theme, "No day is the same in a Jeep Gladiator."; Instead of pitching it to a hip  
As we inch closer to the contest on Sunday, Feb. 9, USA TODAY Ad Meter will cover all your Super Bowl commercial needs. Even though we're still a ways away from the occasion, buzz about the advertising campaigns‚Äîthat many enjoy most about game day‚Äîis starting to heat up. AD METER 2025: Sign up to rate all the big game commercials! 
How Jeep‚Äôs Bill Murray ‚ÄòGroundhog Day‚Äô Super Bowl Ad Came to Be. Jeep's ad with Bill Murray that aired during Sunday night's Super Bowl game nearly didn't happen ‚Äî here's how it came to be. 
That commercial featured Rachel Dratch, Chris Evans, John Krasinski and now Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer David Ortiz. It‚Äôs a grand chapter in Ad Meter history, and could be the last-ever Super Bowl/Groundhog Day crossover we see. With the NFL‚Äôs still-new-ish schedule expansion to 17 games, the Super Bowl now usually falls a week later. 
This Sunday isn't only the Super Bowl, it's Groundhog Day, and what better way to celebrate both than with a big game commercial that includes Bill Murray.. That's exactly the route Jeep decided  
People Magazine named ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù its #1 favorite commercial (in its top 10 list); Adweek named ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù as the number one Super Bowl commercial in 2020; Ad Age ‚ÄúCreativity‚Äù named it the ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Pick‚Äù; and Advertising Age gave the commercial a rating of "five footballs," one of only four brands to receive that  </p>
