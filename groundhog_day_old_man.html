Groundhog Day - Phil's Errands: An expert from his repetitive days, Phil (Bill Murray) runs some errands which include saving a child from a tree and fixing  
A number of factors taken into consideration include the general belief that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything (in Phil's case, regarding learning French, piano, ice sculpturing, etc.), days on screen (38), days mentioned (414) and gesture days (trying to save the old man, falling kid, etc). 
Given you were understandably likely bawling your eyes out, you may have missed a little nod hidden in the Groundhog Day scene where Phil tries to save the old homeless man from dying. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The first time the old man dies (that Phil is aware of) the nurse tells Phil "He was just old. It was his time. sometimes people die." To which Phil responses "Not today." The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment. 
I do not think that is his biological father, the movie shows over time, how to actually be happy. By taking care of others, Phil becomes truly happy. He does everything he can to help that old man. He does everything he can to show that man some kindness. For no other reason than he doesn't want someone to die on the one day he is trapped in.

Roger Ebert didn't initially give Groundhog Day a glowing review. Following that, Groundhog Day was hailed by spiritual leaders, and he gave a re-review in which he honestly said he needed to look a little deeper to really appreciate what the movie really was able to do. 
Phil learns the fragility (and preciousness) of life through his repeated and futile attempts to save a dying, homeless old man whom he was mean to in the first years of his stay on Groundhog Day. This is especially heartbreaking because the old man looks EXTREMELY happy and grateful from the very first moment Phil meets him in the evening. 
Between his age, the diseases and disorders he could have been suffering from, and the scientifically-proven effects of poverty upon the human body, the homeless old man was simply too far gone, health-wise, by February 2nd, 1993 to have ever lived to see February 3rd, no matter what Phil did or did not do during the loop. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre,  he repeatedly tries and fails to save the life of the old man he had ignored until recently. 
In the original pitch of that movie to producers Ramis says that Phil lived the same day for 10,000 years. This kinda freaked them out. In the end they left it ambiguous saying that it was how ever long it takes to learn to play the piano.

Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual. Even though Phil Connors’ life resets every February 2 at 6:00 a.m., the movie also shows that for each Groundhog Day he experiences, the world still continues on for  
At first, Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray’s sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. </p>
