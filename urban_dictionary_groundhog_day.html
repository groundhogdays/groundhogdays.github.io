        <p>The same day over and over. Doing the same things repetitively. From the movie of the same name starring Bill Murray. 
Jan 16th Martin Luther King Day The Black Groundhog always sleeps in and we get stuck with six more weeks of black history 
To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently. 
The Urban Thesaurus was created by indexing millions of different slang terms which are defined on sites like Urban Dictionary. These indexes are then used to find usage correlations between slang terms. The official Urban Dictionary API is used to show the hover-definitions. Note that this thesaurus is not in any way affiliated with Urban  
Groundhog Day is a slang term that refers to a situation where someone is stuck in a repetitive and monotonous cycle. The term comes from the movie Groundhog Day  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Annual day of rest and/or leisure for all criminal occupations. Observed February 2nd, celebrations often involve use of cannibis and/or alcohol. 
Groundhog Day definition: 1. in the US, 2 February, which, according to an old story, is the day the groundhog wakes up after. Learn more. 
Based on the movie "Groundhog Day" starring Bill Murray. It is the idea that every action that one makes; the rewards and consequences of those actions are not followed through the next day. 
The prominence of the groundhog as a popular figure in the country lore of the Eastern States is shown by his having been given a place with the Saints on the calendar, February 2 being widely known as "Groundhog Day." It is claimed that on this date the groundhog wakes from his long winter sleep and appears at the mouth of his burrow to look  
When a man/woman stops speaking to you for a long period of time, leading you to believe that you've been ghosted, but texts or calls sporadically enough to keep you interested, before heading back underground for another "six weeks of winter". 
Whenever feces slowly emerges from your anus after trying to hold it in for too long, similar to the head of a groundhog peeking out from its burrow. 
A lightweight sounding but serious mental illness that consumes some people to the point of living for that single day of the year when Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his hidden place; what’s worse is the full picture of obsessive preparation often leading to ruinous financial consequences and severe social isolation that sometimes accompanies this devastating disorder. 
The same day over and over. Doing the same things repetitively. From the movie of the same name starring Bill Murray. 
The phenomenon of having to come out as transgender to the same person/people repeatedly because they assumed or hoped that your gender identity was a "phase." Refers less to the holiday and more to the 1993 Bill Murray comedy film in which the main character experiences the same day over and over. 
The phenomenon of having to come out as bisexual to the same person/people repeatedly because they assumed or hoped that your sexuality was a "phase." Refers less to the holiday and more to the 1993 Bill Murray comedy film in which the main character experiences the same day over and over. 
The day right after Groundhog Day. With the determination of how many more weeks of winter on February 2nd of each year by the Groundhog, a hilarious internet response began soon after on the premise of the Randall "Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger" you tube sensation. 
Jan 16th Martin Luther King Day The Black Groundhog always sleeps in and we get stuck with six more weeks of black history 
The act of biting the head off a bat to see if there will be 6 more weeks of quarantine. 
A holiday exactly two months after Valentine's. Also known as Single's Awareness Day. Single people(usually teenagers) wear black. </p>
