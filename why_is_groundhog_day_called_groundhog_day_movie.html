The history of Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is typically celebrated in the US and Canada and began in the 16th century.This holiday is thought to have stemmed from superstition in the community of Pennsylvania or the Pennsylvania Dutch, though Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor who specializes in part in the study of Pennsylvania Dutch, believes the tradition may date back to

It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people.
