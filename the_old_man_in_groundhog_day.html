A number of factors taken into consideration include the general belief that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything (in Phil's case, regarding learning French, piano, ice sculpturing, etc.), days on screen (38), days mentioned (414) and gesture days (trying to save the old man, falling kid, etc). 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. The film stars Bill Murray in the lead who portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre,  he repeatedly tries and fails to save the life of the old man he had ignored until recently. 
The old homeless man is in poor health, so Phil takes him to the hospital. Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita. 
I do not think that is his biological father, the movie shows over time, how to actually be happy. By taking care of others, Phil becomes truly happy. He does everything he can to help that old man. He does everything he can to show that man some kindness. For no other reason than he doesn't want someone to die on the one day he is trapped in. 
The first time the old man dies (that Phil is aware of) the nurse tells Phil "He was just old. It was his time. sometimes people die." To which Phil responses "Not today." The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment. 
Following that, Groundhog Day was hailed by spiritual leaders,  This little detail: You see the old man's breath slowly fade as if his soul is escaping.﻿ 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

Between his age, the diseases and disorders he could have been suffering from, and the scientifically-proven effects of poverty upon the human body, the homeless old man was simply too far gone, health-wise, by February 2nd, 1993 to have ever lived to see February 3rd, no matter what Phil did or did not do during the loop. 
If it’s true that every dog has his day, so does a groundhog.  year-old Racine woman was charged Tuesday in connection to a Dec. 6 hit-and-run that resulted in the death of a 44-year-old man.  
In the original pitch of that movie to producers Ramis says that Phil lived the same day for 10,000 years. This kinda freaked them out. In the end they left it ambiguous saying that it was how ever long it takes to learn to play the piano. 
At first Phil ignores the old man. Later Phil gives him money and during another Groundhog Day Phil takes him to the hospital. On that day, Phil is obviously emotionally committed to the old man, demanding to see the chart and refusing to accept the nurse’s evaluation of the situation. Then Phil tries to feed the old man and struggles to  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
Groundhog Day has been a media favorite ever since. I attribute this to dull Februarys. This winter month is filled with 28 or 29 slow news days every year. Old Clymer Freas died in Brooksville, Florida, in 1942. Smart man. He figured out how to beat the extra six weeks of winter in Pennsylvania. Source: Groundhog.org; Findagrave.com </p>
