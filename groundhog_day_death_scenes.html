As wonderful a movie as Groundhog Day is, it never explains the nature of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) being trapped in a time loop.  The Deleted Scene. This scene was deleted in the truest sense  
Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time.
