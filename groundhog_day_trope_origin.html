        <p>Though not the earliest example, this trope is named after the 1993 film Groundhog Day, which established the trope in Western popular culture. The Ur-Example of the trope is The Defence of Duffer's Drift from 1904, although in that case the loop traversals are dreams of Lieutenant Backsight Forethought which permit him (and the reader) to  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a

An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd. 
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
Although it seems like a lighthearted event, Groundhog Day has deep roots in European customs and has evolved over centuries to become a staple of American culture. In this blog post, we will explore the history of Groundhog Day, tracing its origins from ancient customs to its status as a modern cultural phenomenon. A Glimpse into Ancient

The trope-naming Bill Murray comedy Groundhog Day is the most commonly known version of this trope, in which Jerkass weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) wakes up every day at 6 A.M. on 2nd February (Groundhog Day) in Punxatawney, PA.

The story spoofs elements of both Groundhog Day and The Hudsucker Proxy—with mouse-eared "Daddy Time" (i. e.
