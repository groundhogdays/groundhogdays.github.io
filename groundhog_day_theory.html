        <p>Feb 3 Larry has a memory only of the last loop of Groundhog Day, and also a memory of Feb 1. Thus the Larry of the last Groundhog Day is in memory continuity with Larry before and after that day, and so these Larrys are memory-theory identical. The Larrys of all the other Days are left out in the cold, identity-wise. 
Under this theory, if German settlement had been centered further north, Groundhog Day would take place at a later date. [124] However, the observed behavior of groundhogs in central New Jersey was that they mostly come out of their burrows in mid-March, regardless of Groundhog Day weather.

SHAPIRO: The Bill Murray comedy about a weatherman who lives the same day over and over has had staying power. Philosophy classes include "Groundhog Day" in their syllabus. There was even a  
The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring. DamianKuzdak/Getty Images Places like Missouri, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  
Harold Ramis’ 1993 film, Groundhog Day, is a charming and heartwarming comedy about an arrogant egotistical weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has a change of heart over the course  
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
Groundhog Day, though simple and light-hearted on the surface, is riven with philosophical insight. Phil is not only wrestling with Nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence, he’s also playing out the Jungian concept of the shadow. It’s no coincidence that the groundhog’s called Phil too. Every day, the question is: Will Phil see his shadow? 
Groundhog Day 2024:  He has a theory for why Groundhog Day became, and remains, so popular in the U.S. "Throughout history, whenever there has been a real strong emphasis on science, its  
In the Fall of 2016, The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club worked with Discovery Studios and Animal planet to create a one hour documentary called: A Groundhog Day Story: The Tale of a Marmot, His Shadow, and the People Who Protect Him. This special aired on Groundhog Day, February 2nd 2017 on the Animal Planet network! 
Under this theory, if German settlement had been centered further north, Groundhog Day would take place at a later date. [124] However, the observed behavior of groundhogs in central New Jersey was that they mostly come out of their burrows in mid-March, regardless of Groundhog Day weather. 
While the "Groundhog Day" theory certainly has some validity, it nevertheless has its fair share of detractors. Given the ambiguous nature of the film's timeline, some fans such as u/831pm aren't

That's right, Groundhog Day's Devil is, in fact, Ned Ryerson. Needle Nose Ned. The theory suggests that Phil is trapped in Punxsutawney because he insults Ned and turns down his offer of a  
groundhog day theory would it be possible to figure out how much time passed in Groundhog's Day, from the first day it started repeating (so on groundhog day obviously), to the day he woke up in a new bed? curious on the length of time spent there, but idk if there's any actual way to calculate that 
The theory makes even more sense when you consider that perhaps, like the actual Groundhog Day, the "point" of the loop is to make Ferris reconsider every aspect of his day and approach to life and actually achieve something by helping someone else (Cameron) and perfecting the romance in his life (Sloane) 
Ok so he's fated to love the producer. But he only has one chance. One day as we all know first impressions matter. But because she's so kind she's willing to give him a day or two to decide. But by the second day she dislikes him more and he's losing his fate His true love forever. And the day ends and he's lost her. 
In my theory the first interaction with the alarm clock is just the start of a normal day. Had he not interacted with Ned he never would've experienced that moment with the alarm clock again. So I'm saying on the first day Ned damns Phil to continually start that day over and over, and he takes his first step into his cursed life.

I love this theory. Also - I think Rita is in on it as well. Rita is an angel. (Phil even refers to her as one earlier). At the end, Rita and Ned both say this is the best day of their lives. They had never met before this scene. Ned asks Phil and Rita to go out together with them, and Rita says, "Let's not spoil it". </p>
