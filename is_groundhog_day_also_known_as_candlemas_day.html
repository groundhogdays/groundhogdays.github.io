        <p>Groundhog Day is celebrated on February 2nd and dictates that if a groundhog emerges from hibernation to see its shadow, and retreats, six more weeks of winter are ahead. This tradition may have European roots and coincides with the Christian holiday of Candlemas, which was about the purification of the Virgin Mary, but also used to indicate  
In Germany, there was a longstanding tradition surrounding the Candlemas festival. February 2nd was known as Dachstag – Badger Day, with a prescribed folk formula in German: “Sonnt sich der Dachs in der Lichtmeßwoche, so geht er auf vier Wochen wieder zu Loche,” which in English is reminiscent of the Groundhog day lore we know: “If the  
The Christian festival known as Candlemas – a festival of light – is also observed on Feb. 2, and is also a precursor to Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog Day’s roots are in the Christian holiday Candlemas,  but he is the best known. He is also known as the "Seers of Seers," the "Prognosticator of Prognosticators," "Weather Predictor  
The saying “Half your wood and half your hay, You should have on Candlemas Day” became a common adage, and was one that was clumsily paraphrased by Henry David Thoreau in his journal entry on February 1, 1857, when Thoreau noted: A laborer on the railroad tells me it is Candlemas Day (February 2d) to-morrow and the winter half out. ‘half  
The History of Groundhog Day. The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
The very concept of Groundhog Day is a fusion of ancient legends, including the Delaware Nation’s great-groundhog Wojak and Christian traditions of Candlemas that trace back to the fourth century. Celebrating Punxsutawney Phil emerging from the ground is also about Americans seeing or not seeing the shadow of the oldest known indigenous tribe  
This Feast is also known as Candlemas Day; the day on which candles are blessed symbolizing Christ who is the light of the world, and the day the Church celebrates World Day for Consecrated life, a reminder that God calls men and women to Religious vocations to reflect the light of Christ to all people,” according to Sister Milasus. 
This eventually evolved into the English associating this tradition with weather predictions, and was known as Candlemas Day. Germany later introduced a hedgehog into the celebration. 
When they settled in Pennsylvania, the groundhog (also known as the woodchuck), which resembles the European hedgehog and emerges from hibernation at that time of year, was chosen to replace the badger. The first official Groundhog Day was celebrated on February 2, 1886, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Candlemas and the Grundsau Candlemas on 2 February, the 40th day following Christmas, is a Roman Catholic and Protestant observance that celebrates an early episode in the life of Jesus. Also known as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple (Darstellung des Herrn in German), or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin (Mariä 
The presentation is 40 days after Christmas. It is also known as Candlemas Day because of the tradition of blessing candles, which we did at the start of our liturgy. Traditionally candles were blessed on this day. In the old calendar, prior to Vatican II, The Presentation of the Lord was also the end of the Christmas season. 
Weather predictions were often associated with this day, as reflected in the old verse: “If Candlemas Day be fair and bright Winter will have another fight. If Candlemas Day brings cloud and rain, Winter won’t come again.” Fans of the film Groundhog Day might recognize a similar tradition. In North American folklore, if Punxsutawney Phil  
Groundhog Day is an annual holiday that occurs on February 2 and is popular in North America. On this day, spectators watch a groundhog also known as a woodchuck, or marmot, leave its burrow. Tradition holds that if the groundhog glimpses its own shadow, there will be six additional weeks of winter. If 
The Christian festival known as Candlemas – a festival of light – is also observed on Feb. 2, and is also a precursor to Groundhog Day. 
Candlemas is also called the Feast of the Presentation, because it honors the day that Mary and Joseph presented the infant Jesus at the Temple. In bringing their child to the Temple and offering a sacrifice, Jesus’ parents were following the Mosaic law (specifically Leviticus 12:6). 
The candles were then lit, and a procession took place through the darkened church while the Canticle of Simeon was sung. Because of this, the feast also became known as Candlemas. While the procession and blessing of the candles is not often performed in the United States today, Candlemas is still an important feast in many European countries.
