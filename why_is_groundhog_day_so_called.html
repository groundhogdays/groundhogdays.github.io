        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous groundhog. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks.

The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
A drink called ‘groundhog punch’ was also served. This was formalised with the formation of the official Punxsutawney Groundhog Club in 1899 which, along with hosting Groundhog Day itself, continued the hunt and feast. Over time, the hunt became a ritualised formality, since the groundhog meat had to be procured ahead of time. 
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
Regardless of the reasons why we turn to a groundhog to predict if spring is coming, Punxsutawney Phil — as every participating hedgehog has been called since 1887 — is never very accurate. Groundhog Day nevertheless represents a day for us to gather together and celebrate that we are halfway through the winter, however much longer the  
This quirky tradition, known as Groundhog Day, has captured the hearts and imaginations of generations. But where did this unusual custom come from, and why has it endured for so long? In this article, we‘ll delve into the rich history of Groundhog Day, exploring its ancient roots, early celebrations, and modern-day significance. 
E very year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day.You  
On a lighter note, people the world over also have one more reason to watch Harold Ramis' 1993 masterpiece Groundhog Day. The "holiday" of Groundhog Day isn't really a holiday, it's just an observance, and, to add insult to injury, technically shouldn't even be called "Groundhog" Day; the tradition dates back to early settlers from what is now

It certainly had a huge impact on the small town though. Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that  
Groundhogs are so famous, they have a day named after them on February 2. Every year on Groundhog Day, a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil comes out of his burrow. According to tradition, if he sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. Otherwise spring will arrive early. But how much do you really know about groundhogs? 
The 1993 comedy movie, Groundhog Day, takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Groundhog Day. The main character (played by Bill Murray) is forced to relive the day over and over again until he can learn to give up his selfishness and become a better person. [18] 
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.
