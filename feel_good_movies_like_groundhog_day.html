        <p>Why you'll like this movie: Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day.

Bill Murray repeating the same day over and over is certainly unique, but here are 12 movies like "Groundhog Day" we think you should check out.

I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right. On top of my head I can think about Back to the Future and Edge of Tomorrow. Do you know any similar movies? Thank you. 
Groundhog Day is easily my favorite movie, and my other favorite movies have a very similar feel. Hook with Robin Williams, and Yes Man with Jim Carrey are really good. It also helps when a funny person is the lead like Bill Murray. 
Want to feel good today? Watch this awesome Movie starring Bill Murray from 1993. Simple yet compelling. Leaves you with great lesson of, Don't live yesterday again, learn something new everyday, be helpful, kind to others &amp; (last but not least) Be Happy. Bill Murray is just too good with his acting. 
Clever conceptual movies like Liar Liar, Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty, Being John Malkovich? I'm looking for movies that are clever and experimental, but also more on the feel good side.

I just don't get how groundhog day has such high ratings when to me it's just like any other average 90's feel good movies that you take your kids with. I don't get how it's ranked among the other greats like the godfather and amadeus as great movies.

You should try to keep a diary. I started writing stuff down in my diary. You can use a real diary but I am using an app. At the end of every day I write down what I have done, who I have met and where I have been. No emotional stuff, no desperate comments. Just a good retelling of your own day. What was good, what made me feel bad. 
Humor is also highlighted here, with romantic comedies like Serendipity and feel-good movies like Groundhog Day. The world is your wintery oyster! 1. The Cutting Edge. 
I have an eclectic taste, so my feel good movies are (in no particular order): Die Hard, Mike &amp; Dave Need Wedding Dates, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bullet Train, Free Guy, While You Were Sleeping, Hocus Pocus, The Money Pit, Groundhog Day, Fletch, and the Ghostbusters movies. </p>
