        <h2><strong>do we have school in groundhog day groundhog used for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>In the United States, whether or not schools have classes on Groundhog Day, also known as February 2nd, largely depends on the school district and the state. Not all schools observe Groundhog Day as a holiday , which means that some schools might have regular hours and classes, while others might be closed. 
The short answer is, it depends. Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd, is a unique holiday that is usually not observed as a federal or state holiday. This means that schools and businesses usually operate as usual. However, some schools and institutions may choose to celebrate Groundhog Day with special activities or events. 
Groundhog Day is not one of the 11 official U.S. Holidays so school is held unless it falls on a weekend. More info on Groundhog day can be found at National Day Calendar. 
Groundhog Day is February 2. That’s a Sunday. So, of course, we have to learn about groundhogs before then. Well, Friday would be the day. That happens to be our 100th day of school. But this year, we all were feeling a little blah about the 100th day, so we decided as a team to celebrate the 101st day of school! 
From the very first day of school, have your students track the number of days they’ve been in school in anticipation of the 100th day, marking the days in ten bundles, paving the way to counting by tens and ones. Have students work in groups to come up with one hundred ways to represent the number “100”. Some examples are: 50+50; 102-2  
In Nova Scotia, Groundhog Day is called Daks Day. This comes from the word “dachs” which is German for badger. While Germans don’t celebrate Groundhog Day, they do celebrate a holiday they call Dachstag on February 2. The history of Groundhog Day goes back hundreds of years to an old European tradition that involved watching for animals  
Your young learners may not know what a groundhog is, let alone why we have a day to celebrate it each year. They might not understand why thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on a cold morning every February to watch a man in a tuxedo hold a groundhog—while many more watch the ceremony live on television. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

The academic year typically has around 180 school teaching days for K-12 students. Colleges and universities tend to have shorter academic years.

Groundhog Day is most famous at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, the site where Punxsutawney Phil leaves his burrow on the morning of Feb. 2 to predict whether we will have an early spring.

The Origins of Groundhog Day. Since it marks the midway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, February 2 has been an important day throughout history, from the Celts’ Imbolc to Christianity’s Candlemas, Feast of the Presentation of Jesus Christ, which stems from the Celts’ pagan festival. 
However, Punxsutawney Phil will let us know Sunday, Groundhog Day, when we can expect spring to officially arrive. Danny Rubin attended Gainesville High School and was the screenwriter for “Groundhog Day” the movie, a 1993 comedy featuring Bill Murray. Via video, he introduced Mayor Harvey Ward on Wednesday. 
It is almost time for the groundhog to make his appearance. As tradition would have it, Groundhog Day is celebrated on Feb. 2 each year. Before Groundhog Day began as we know it, Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 1800s brought many traditions.
