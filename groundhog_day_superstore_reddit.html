It looks like Gary the groundhog actually got seriously hurt with a major injury from Amy putting her hand on him and the cage falling. 
The next day, they say about tate left his credit card so Amy had to pay the whole tab. Tate was supposed to get paid for drug dealing but didn't so he "forgot his card" lol little Easter egg in this episode!!

There’s an official Groundhog Day game on PSVR, it’s a sequel where you play as Phil’s son. It’s quality is a bit inconsistent and pacing is slow at times but does a good job of giving you puzzles you can solve with prior knowledge of a scene.
