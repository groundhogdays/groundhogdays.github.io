        <p>Today all across the US and Canada, many communities celebrate their own version of Groundhog Day. In Canada alone, there are a half dozen places with a Groundhog Day tradition. In French Canada the day is called Jour de la marmotte. “Fred la marmotte of Val-d’Espoir” has been the winter forecaster for the province of Quebec since 2009. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
February 2 is Groundhog Day in the U.S. and Canada, though probably everybody in the world knows about this weather-predicting custom since the movie Groundhog Day (Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier) with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell came out in 1993. But I would bet few know of the German origins of this weather lore day. What is Groundhog Day? Every year on February 2 in the  
(Apparently Groundhog tastes like a cross between pork and chicken. YIKES!) The Groundhog feast eventually faded away (thankfully) but the visit to Gobbler’s Knob continued, and became more ritualistic. Since the release of the film Groundhog Day, the crowd in Punxsutawney has grown from 2000 to over 10,000 visitors. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Feb. 2 is one of the quirkiest and most whimsical traditions celebrated in North America – Groundhog Day! The holiday finds its roots in a German tradition that dates back to the 18th century. The legend goes that if a hibernating animal, often a Badger or a “Dachstag” in German, saw its shadow on Candlemas 
So, as you witness Punxsutawney Phil emerge (or not), remember: Groundhog Day isn’t just about predicting spring; it’s a timeless exploration of human potential, reminding us that every day, like a blank February 2nd, holds the possibility for a new beginning. Canada also joins the groundhog fun. 
Groundhog Day. It’s February 2 nd —Groundhog Day. And once again we have the Germans and the Victorian Era to thank for this U.S. holiday custom. According to this tradition, if a groundhog comes out of its hole on February 2 nd and sees its shadow, it gets scared and runs back into its burrow, predicting six more weeks of winter weather. 
“Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks  
The town of Punxsutawney, PA soon became known for their groundhog, and in 1886, it was unanimously decided that the town groundhog, named Phil, would be used for the new German holiday on Feb. 2, “Groundhog Day.” Since that day, the holiday has become an international sensation broadcasted around the world. For the past 134 years, people  
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end. 
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog Day Top Events and Things to Do. Visit Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and see Phil the groundhog in person. Watch the movie Groundhog Day (1993) starring Bill Murray. Host a Groundhog Day party. Record the emergence of Phil from his hole and play it back at the party. 
The Groundhog Day ceremony held at Punxsutawney in western Pennsylvania, centering on a semi-mythical groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, has become the most frequently attended ceremony. Grundsow Lodges in Pennsylvania Dutch Country in the southeastern part of the state observe the occasion as well. Other cities in the United States and Canada  
The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
The history of Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is typically celebrated in the US and Canada and began in the 16th century.This holiday is thought to have stemmed from superstition in the community of Pennsylvania or the Pennsylvania Dutch, though Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor who specializes in part in the study of Pennsylvania Dutch, believes the tradition may date back to  
A sunny day means seeing more shadows. Smit / shutterstock The Scottish, the English, and the Germans all have similar rhymes about the weather on Candlemas, but it is the Germans we have to thank for Groundhog’s Day. The Germans were the ones to connect this tradition to an animal: a hedgehog, in their case. 
The groundhog wakes up from hibernation on February 2. If the groundhog sees its shadow when it emerges from its burrow, there will be six more weeks of winter. If it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive soon. This tradition started in Europe as Candlemas Day. Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 1700s brought the custom to America
