        <p>14 days. Columbia Pictures' notes on the movie included a request that the number of days in Phil's time loop be cut way down.  Keeping the total number of days to 14 may, in a 1990s studio  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Groundhog Day (1993) - According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends eight years, eight months and sixteen days trapped in Groundhog Day. The Movie Truth review series calculated Murray spent 4,576 days (twelve years, six months, and eleven days) stuck in the loop. While the website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under thirty-four years, in order to  
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
To get to this number, Gallagher began counting each separate day shown onscreen in Groundhog Day, which adds up to 38 days total. Next, he calculated all the different events that Phil mentions  
There are 38 days depicted in the film either as a full day or partial moments, but it's clear Phil was around for a lot more than that. On the DVD commentary, Ramis says Phil lived the day for ten thousand years but later amended it to ten years. Some fans have put in heavy research to conclude the total of days to be 12,403. 
In answer to the title question, there are 34 days that are shown in the movie but years and years of days we don't see that are hinted at in the days we do see. In the movie Groundhog Day, Weatherman Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray), finds himself waking up to the same day over and over again. At first he takes advantage of the situation  
Keeping the total number of days to 14 may, in a 1990s studio exec's thinking, have been more palatable to the average sitcom audience. Luckily, Harold Ramis stuck to his guns, and produced a movie in which the answer is more ambiguous — but definitely longer than two weeks. Between 34 and 44 days

A movie that continually replays a single day could quickly become tedious but, strangely enough, Groundhog Day never does. Entertainment Weekly September 7, 2011 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
This carefully curated list brings together the best movies that deliver the magical narrative style reminiscent of Groundhog Day.Each recommendation has been handpicked and then further refined by the enthusiastic votes of Ranker fans like you, ensuring that it resonates with audiences who enjoy the unique blend of humor and existential themes. 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
This is where the events of the movie "Groundhog Day" take place, where Phil finds himself stuck in a time loop reliving the same day over and over again. The town of Pittsburgh serves as the setting for the film's storyline and is where Phil experiences his repeated days until he learns the lessons needed to break free from the cycle. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple.  Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least
