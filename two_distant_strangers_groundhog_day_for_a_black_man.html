What Two Distant Strangers and Groundhog Day for a Black Man do share is an unabashed debt to Groundhog Day. Danny Rubin, the writer of that 1993 film, said he was unaware of this recent

The accusations come via a TikTok from Cynthia Koa, who created a short back in December 2016 released on YouTube called Groundhog Day for a Black Man. She lays the case that the Netflix short may have stolen the concept because of a link between her original video and NowThis, an online publication with big footprints on social media. 
Two Distant Strangers is a 30-minute short film that features much more backstory and character development of both the protagonist and the police officer. Groundhog Day for a Black Man, on the other hand, is a four-minute short film that focuses almost entirely on the interactions themselves.

The film directed by Free and Martin Desmond Roe uses a “Groundhog Day”-style premise to tell a powerful story about police violence against Black men "Two Distant Strangers" / Dirty Robber. 
‘Two Distant Strangers’ – When Art Imitates Life: Repetition The ‘ Groundhog Day ’ trope is having a moment.

Two Distant Strangers is a 2020 short film (32 minutes) directed by Travon Free and Martin Desmond Roe.. The setting is New York. A young black man named Carter (played by rapper Joey Bada$$), wakes up one morning in the apartment of Perri, the beautiful young black woman he just had sex with. 
On April 30, filmmaker Cynthia Kao posted a video to TikTok in which she drew connections between her four-minute short film titled Groundhog Day for a Black Man and Free's project. Kao explained  
It’s called Two Distant Strangers and is very good. It’s more serious than this one, but does still have some humor in it. That one is available on Netflix. Edit: I wasn’t aware of the controversy.
