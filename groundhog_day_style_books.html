For that reason, it can be easy to overlook the “smaller” holidays like Groundhog Day. However, in my experience, kids are absolutely obsessed with Punxsutawney Phil and his weather predictions!

The Groundhog Day Book of Facts and Fun – Wendie Old. This one is packed full of information. It’s set up more like a chapter book – with long paragraphs and TONS of information. I’d compare this to the content that Gail Gibbons’ Groundhog Day! book has, but on massive steroids.

Just in time for Groundhog’s Day (the holiday), we have a list of great time loop novels like Groundhog’s Day (the movie)! Just kidding! If you’re familiar with the 1993 film, you know that reporter Bill Murray gets stuck in a small town covering the news about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who may or may not see his shadow.

The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre.
