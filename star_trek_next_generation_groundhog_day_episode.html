        <p>18th episode of the 5th season of Star Trek: The Next Generation "Cause and Effect" Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Episode no. Season 5 Episode 18 Directed by Jonathan Frakes Written by Brannon Braga Featured music Dennis McCarthy Production code 218 Original air date March 23, 1992 (1992-03-23) Guest appearances Kelsey Grammer – Morgan Bateson Michelle Forbes – Ro Laren Patti  
Star Trek: The Next Generation innovated several science fiction storylines, and their time loop episode is no exception. In “Cause and Effect”, Episode 18 of the show’s fifth season, the  
Braga noted that while time loops are often associated with the film Groundhog Day, the episode was written and aired before the movie. (Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, p. 249) The story was still missing some elements. According to Braga, "I came up with the poker game while I was eating pancakes and pouring syrup. I had no idea how it  
Cause and Effect: Directed by Jonathan Frakes. With Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn. The Enterprise gets caught in a time loop which always has one result: total destruction of the ship itself. 
And go anywhere it did, including a brave time-loop episode that helped to give birth popularize the mind-twisting genre, a year before the release of Groundhog Day. In Star Trek TNG season 5, audiences were met with the episode ‘Cause and Effect 
Ah, the episode that inspired Groundhog Day! As long as you don’t examine the slightly preposterous premise too closely, this is one of the best Star Trek episodes ever. I love it! Especially the use of different camera angles when a scene is repeated to give it a fresh look. There’s not much more to say. 4 stars easily. 
Some interesting additional info about Groundhog day that people might not realize. Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
Groundhog Day may have influenced later stories and set a standard (like Night of the Living Dead did for what we now call zombies) but as has been pointed out it was not the first. Another example: Richard A. Lupoff's short story "12:01 P.M." which was published in late 1973, and adapted to film twice, in 1990 and again in 1993 after Groundhog  
This week in Sci-Fi Time Capsule, one of my favorite episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation: “Cause and Effect,” from Season 5, Episode 18. It doesn’t involve Klingons, Romulans, Borg, or any mysterious planet or moral dilemma. What classic Star Trek trope does this one play on? Time. (WARNING: Spoilers begin below) 
While the same-day repeat concept became popular with American audiences Groundhog Day in 1993 and has since become a cinema staple in films like edge of tomorrow, PalmSpringsand the Happy death anniversary Franchise, star trek premiered the story of her episode the year before in 1992 Bill Murray suffered his famous vacation. 
Directed by Jonathan Frakes – who plays William T. Riker in the show – “Cause and Effect” takes the typical time loop story and perfects the craft, resulting in one of the most popular episodes in Star Trek: The Next Generation’s fifth season. 
What’s strange is that this episode of Star Trek: the Next Generation does a Groundhog Day theme a year before Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day movie comes into play. While there are a lot of GHD plots in various genre and film and TV shows, I think Star Trek’s might be first. Did they get the [] 
It's a Monday in the spring of 1992, and I'm 12 years old. I finished my homework, rushed downstairs to park myself on the couch in front of the TV, and flipped on Star Trek: The Next Generation. THE ENTERPRISE IS EXPLODING. The bridge is in chaos: the starboard nacelle has taken a direct hit, casualty reports are coming in from all over the  
Episodes from TV-Shows where the protagonists live through the same day over and over again.  Groundhog Day Episodes.  Star Trek: The Next Generation. 
Original air date: March 23, 1992 We begin this episode In Medias Res, with the Enterprise's engines on fire and the ship out of control. The bridge crew is frantically trying to steady the ship long enough to launch the lifeboats as Picard  
Decades earlier, The Next Generation popularized this trope in the Season 5 "Cause and Effect." This Star Trek twist on the Groundhog Day premise -- a year before Groundhog Day's premiere -- had the Enterprise caught in a temporal loop with the time-displaced U.S.S. Bozeman, resulting in both ships' cyclical destruction. As the crew members  
But as a concept, time loops go way back before Groundhog Day, including a 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone, 'Shadow Play',  Star Trek: The Next Generation - 'Cause and Effect' 
Warning: contains SPOILERS for Episode 7 of Star Trek: Discovery!. Ain't no party like a Star Trek: Discovery party 'cause a Star Trek: Discovery party has time loops. It also has an uninvited guest: Harcourt Fenton Mudd (Rainn Wilson), the rouge charlatan who was last seen left behind in a Klingon prison ship in episode 5 'Choose Your Pain'. 
T he Star Trek franchise has a straightforward mandate when it comes to making individual episodes. The writers select a science fiction idea with varying levels of grounded realism. Each concept  
This well-received episode of TNG sees the Enterprise-D crash and explode several times in a complicated time loop. </p>
