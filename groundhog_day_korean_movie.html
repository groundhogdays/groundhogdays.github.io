        <h2><strong>groundhog day korean movie is groundhog day movie kid friendly</strong></h2>
        <p>A Day is a 2017 South Korean mystery thriller film directed by Cho Sun-ho. The film starring Kim Myung-min and Byun Yo-han, revolves around a father who commits an unethical act in an attempt to save his daughter's life. Three years later, his actions return to haunt him, trapping him in an endless time loop. 
One day, he sees his daughter die in an accident in front of him. From that moment, the same day repeats itself and he struggles to find the secret of that day with ambulance driver Lee Min-Chul (Byun Yo-Han). Notes. Filming began June 29, 2016 at Songdo Central Park in Incheon, South Korea and finished September 29, 2016. 
A Day: Directed by Jo Sun-ho. With Kim Myung-min, Byun Yo-han, Shin Hye-sun, Jo Eun-hyung. A mystery drama revolving around a father who commits an unethical act in an attempt to save his daughter's life. 
There are many movies from Groundhog Day (1993) to Happy Death Day (2017) where the protagonist relives the same day again and again. This Korean time-loop movie is based on the same concept but explores the consequences and redemption of an act. 
Ultimately, A Day is a Groundhog Day premise with Hitchcockian twists, and a delectable dollop of the bittersweet that audiences have come to expect from such South Korean stunners as The Handmaiden, Mother, and I Saw The Devil. Even when you get a happy ending in this oeuvre, it’s one edged with brilliant pain. 
A desperate father relives the day of his daughter's death in Cho Sun-ho's time-loop action pic 'A Day.' 
Only South-Korean cinema knows how to pull that off, and still make it believable. Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 01/31/23 Full Review Read all reviews A Day 
If you like Groundhog Day but want to see a tension thriller instead this is the movie, it all takes place on the same day trying to stop an accident from happening, but the twist and turns keep pilling up and is just a roller coaster from start to finish. Not one slow moment in the movie. 
Watch A Day (2017) free starring Kim Myung-min, Byun Yo-han, Yoo Jae-myung and directed by Cho Sun-ho. A mystery drama revolving around a father who commits an unethical act in an attempt to save his daughter's life. 
M(a)y Korea 2024 #28 - Wild Card – Any South Korean movie from M(a)y Korea 2024. Progress: 39/31 "Ha-roo" aka "A Day" was well crafted, surprising and quite enjoyable. The plot was actually quite mysterious and surprising, in that the approach was somewhat "different". 
Groundhog Day 2. Bill Murray stars in one of the best comedies of the ’90s, reuniting with his co-star from Ghostbusters, Harold Ramis, who directs the movie.It co-stars Andie McDowell and Chris Elliott. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great.
