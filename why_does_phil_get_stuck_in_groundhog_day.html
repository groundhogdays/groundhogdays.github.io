        <h2><strong>why does phil get stuck in groundhog day what does groundhog day represent</strong></h2>
        <p>Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
9. What is the moral lesson of Groundhog Day? Groundhog Day teaches us the importance of personal growth, kindness, and finding joy in everyday moments. It reminds us that true happiness lies in our ability to change ourselves and connect with others. 10. Does Phil remember anything from the time loop after escaping? 
GROUNDHOG DAY never explained why Bill Murray's Phil was trapped in time or what broke the spell, but the original script reveals everything. By Stefan Kyriazis , Arts Editor 16:54, Thu, Feb 2  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while trapped in this time loop. 
Punxsutawney Phil controls the time loop. The Seer of Seers and Prognosticator of Prognosticators was deeply offended when Connors called him a "large squirrel predicting the weather." Phil isn't a squirrel and he isn't predicting shit. He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. Phil lived his life constantly pushing others away, trying to be aloof, above, and fake. He made himself miserable this way, crafting himself a living hell that got worse every day. 
In a first draft of the script a spurned ex turns out to be a witch and curses him. This is specifically why, when Phil and Rita kiss at the end of the movie, there's a sound like tinkling bells (or whatever; doing this from memory). That was the moment th 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Beside above, why does Phil get stuck in Groundhog Day? The second draft of Groundhog Day says, actually, it was caused by Phil's scorned ex-girlfriend Stephanie. But also in the second draft, Stephanie, Phil's ex-girlfriend, puts a curse on him. Literally, she opens a book of magic spells and does a little ritual that causes him to get stuck  
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
I thought that Ned was living the single day over and over, but without the cumulative knowledge of each day like Phil had. in essence, this would allow Ned only experienced the same day over and over without needing to go insane from the sensory overload, while also being able to recognize the day Phil decided to buy his insurance and thus reverse the loop. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! Despite  
He ponders why Murray's Phil deserved such a hefty punishment and points to the second draft of the script for an explanation. Apparently it has to do with a curse that Phil's ex-girlfriend put on him. "Literally, she opens a book of magic spells and does a little ritual that causes him to get stuck in time.
