        <p>In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
Believe it or not, the holiday did exist before both the Bill Murray movie and Hallmark Cards. As we reported a few years back, the history of Groundhog Day has its roots in the Christian holiday  
Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned Ryserson, in the movie Groundhog Day, attended the 2010 Groundhog Day Celebration in Punxsutawney. Danny Rubin, writer of the screenplay Groundhog Day, attended Groundhog Day 2013. This was the first time he attend Groundhog Day since before the movie was released. 
Groundhog Day is on Sunday, Feb. 2. The celebrations revolving around Groundhog Day will go on for multiple days that week, Phil will make his prediction early in the morning. Looking back:Did the  
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
The average draw had been about 2,000 until the 1993 film Groundhog Day, which is set at the festivities in Punxsutawney, after which attendance rose to about 10,000. [ 41 ] The official Phil is pretended to be a supercentenarian , having been the same forecasting beast since 1887. [ 41 ] 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
But Punxsutawney Phil became something of a cult celebrity even before the film debuted – he appeared on the "Today" show in 1960, according to the York Daily Record, and visited the White House  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The popularity of Groundhog Day skyrocketed in 1993 with the release of the movie "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again in Punxsutawney. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $70 million at the box office and earning a 96% approval  
The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
Some viewers may be surprised to learn that there was no major reason why Groundhog Day was the holiday chosen for the film's backdrop. In an online interview with [the film's] writer [Danny] Rubin, he explains: "There were many reasons that Groundhog Day was a good arbitrary choice. It was a good choice because it's in the dead of winter. 
We would like to show you a description here but the site won’t allow us. 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
The setup of the film, where Phil and Rita – ultimately played by Andie MacDowell – are sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities, is instead covered in voiceover as Phil leaves the boarding  
Here we go again: Time loop stories were around long before the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. So a friendly reminder that one person's discovery of something isn't the same as its invention. 
Though fans will likely never get to see a Groundhog Day 2, there have been off-shoots of the film that exist in other media.Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son is a virtual reality video game  
Groundhog Day had many people rolling in laughter when it came out in 1993, just as it does today. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this film is the brand of comedy embodied by Bill Murray’s  
Combining action with the time loop narrative, Boss Level features a protagonist who relives the day of his death, mirroring the repetitive cycle seen in Groundhog Day. The film's blend of dark humor and thrilling sequences aligns with the existential themes and comedic undertones of Groundhog Day, as each loop provides an opportunity for the  </p>
