        <h2><strong>happy death day groundhog day groundhog day radio script</strong></h2>
        <p>Happy Death Day is a 2017 American black comedy slasher film directed by Christopher Landon and written by Scott Lobdell.It stars Jessica Rothe and Israel Broussard.. The film follows college student Tree Gelbman, who is murdered on the night of her birthday but begins reliving the day repeatedly, at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death. 
Review. When the premise of Groundhog Day meets the slasher horror sub-genre, the result is surprisingly fun. This delightful tone is immediately obvious from the first few frames, as the Universal logo repeats itself three times, perfectly setting the mood for the story to come. 
“Happy Death Day,” a horror riff on the “Groundhog Day” model, opens with the Universal logo stopping and restarting, just as the company name is circling the globe. It’s a clever riff on the fact that audiences know what they’re coming to see—a film in which the same events repeat over and over again. 
I love the Groundhog Day reference at the end, it gave the movie some more cred imo as it isn't trying to be 100% original and Groundhog Day was 1993 and not, well, a slasher and also because Groundhog Day is 1 of my favorite movies. I've been seeing it every year on Groundhog Day since I was a kid. gets a 9/10 for me. 
The final scene of Happy Death Day-- which features Israel Broussard's Carter noting to Jessica Rothe's Tree that her ordeal sounds a lot like Groundhog Day-- is a great joke, mostly because there  
The time-warped slasher Happy Death Day is the horror genre's answer to Groundhog Day, but that ending requires some deeper examination. Happy Death Day is about a sorority sister stuck in a time loop, trying to solve her own murder. 
Happy Death Day: Directed by Christopher Landon. With Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Ruby Modine, Charles Aitken. A college student must relive the day of her murder over and over again, in a loop that will end only when she discovers her killer's identity. 
Christopher B. Landon’s “Happy Death Day” doesn’t break out its first “Groundhog Day” joke until well into its third act, but the Jason Blum-produced horror film wears its cinematic  
Happy Death Day makes not the least effort to conceal its lineage – almost from the get-go this is quite blatantly Groundhog Day (1993) reworked as a slasher movie. It even tosses in a cheekily explicit nod to Harold Ramis’s cult film in its final scene, when the heroine’s new boyfriend tells her that her story “reminds me of Groundhog Day. 
Happy Death Day is coming as one of the few originals (if you can call a horror movie rip-off of Ground Hog day original), in a Halloween season that sees sequels to Saw, Child's Play and

It's fun. I haven't seen pt2 but pt1. It was cool to see a horror version of groundhog's day. Look at this way: you're going to watch a movie anyways. 
It's inspired by "Groundhog Day," but some find "Happy Death Day" much more intriguing than the original black comedy. Urban Daddy's Sam Eichner writes: Happy Death Day, the Blumhouse horror movie which came out last year and is now available to stream on Amazon, is not fine. It’s better than fine. It’s fucking awesome. 
'Happy Death Day' and 'Freaky' are basically the horror versions of 'Groundhog Day' and 'The Hot Chick', respectively. What movie with a fantasy-esque twist should get a slasher reworking next? 
Happy Death Day is coming as one of the few originals (if you can call a horror movie rip-off of Ground Hog day original), in a Halloween season that sees sequels to Saw, Child's Play and  
Conclusion: Happy Death Day. With Halloween weighing heavily on its side, Happy Death Day is a harmless horror film that will content slasher fans. It follows in the footstep of Scream while adopting the premise of Groundhog Day. 
FYI I did see Happy Death Day 1 and 2 and I liked them both a lot  All of these are more action/sci-fi, not about life lessons like Groundhog Day Reply reply

REVIEW: 'Happy Death Day' is the horror thriller version of 'Groundhog Day' you didn't know you wanted Kirsten Acuna 2017-10-11T16:45:00Z
