        <p>The pronunciation is mostly wrong and the words are mumbled. Maybe it sounds French enough to fool the director and the producers of the movie But not me. P. P.-S. And it’s not old French poetry, the poem is inspired by the song La bourrée du célibataire by Jacques Brel (translated as Bachelor’s Dance). « La fille que j’aimera » is

The poem Phil quoted to Rita was actually not 16th-century French poetry, but rather a song by Jacques Brel called La bourrée du célibataire (Bachelor's Dance). I had trouble finding translated lyrics, other than this from wikipedia: "The girl I will love is like a fine wine that gets a little better every morning."

Bill Murray 
- Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. - La fille qui j'aimerai sera comme bon vin qui se bonifiera un peu chaque matin. - You speak French! - Oui. - I haven't done this since I was a kid. - Me neither. It's fun! - It's good, clean fun. - I hope that one day I can do this with my own children. - Where'd you get that? 
My favourite part: Rita (Andie MacDowell) tells Phil (Bill Murray) that she studied 19th-century French poetry. The first time she says it, he laughs at her -- "Really? What a waste of time." -- and she recoils, not a little disgusted with his philistinism.

The French poem Bill recites in the pub is from this Jacques Brel song – rather than a 19th century French poem. 21. The initial scenes where Phil does his weather report and we meet Rita were  
TIL that the french poem Phil recites for Rita in Groundhog Day translates to: "The girl that I will love/Will be like good wine/Which will improve/A bit each morning," as a nod to the movie's plot. 
Groundhog Day. Edit. Bill Murray was bitten by the groundhog twice during shooting. Murray had to have anti rabies injections, because the bites were so severe. 
A great memorable quote from the Groundhog Day movie on Quotes.net - Phil: When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone.

What poem is recited in Groundhog Day? And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing, Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.” The French poem that Phil recites in the German restaurant was written by the film’s co-writer Danny Rubin , based on the lyrics of Jacques Brel ‘s “Bachelor’s Dance”. 
You're a sucker for French poetry and rhinestones. You're very generous. You're kind to strangers and children, and when you stand in the snow you look like an angel. Rita: How are you doing this? Phil: I told you. I wake up every day, right here, right in Punxsutawney, and it's always February 2nd, and there's nothing I can do about it.

RITA: Believe it or not, I studied 19th Century French poetry. Phil's first reaction is to think poetry is a total waste of time. But after he realizes this response won't win Rita over, he goes out and learns how to speak French just to impress her. Rita is no fool though.
