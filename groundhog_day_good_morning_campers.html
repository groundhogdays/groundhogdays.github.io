In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie. Poor Phil Connors (played with excellent drollness by Bill Murray) was forced to wake up day after day, reliving each run-in with Needlenose Ned, his producer Rita, and his cameraman, Larry. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone.

The Groundhog Day Alarm Clock consists of a Panasonic RC-6025 flip clock modified to play the audio from the movie Groundhog Day when the alarm goes off.
