        <h2><strong>what does ned say in groundhog day groundhog day calculation</strong></h2>
        <p>It’s Groundhog Day, everyone – and in addition to letting a rodent tell us if we’ll suffer through another six weeks of winter, it’s also the perfect day to look back at the best quotes from that annoying former high school classmate-turned-insurance-salesman who pesters Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors into buying life insurance in the classic 1993 film “Groundhog Day.” 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day is a beloved comedy film that has stood the test of time, and one of the standout characters is Ned Ryerson. Played by Stephen Tobolowsky, Ned Ryerson is a quirky and persistent insurance salesman who is always trying to sell policies to the film’s protagonist, Phil Connors. 
You know, I have friends who live and die by the actuarial tables and I say, "Hey! It's all one big crap-shoot anywho!" Tell me, have you ever heard of single premium life because I think that could really be the ticket for you. 
Phil: Rita, I’m reliving the same day over and over. Groundhog Day. Today. Rita: Okay. I’m waiting for the punch line. Phil: No. Really. This is the third time. It’s like yesterday never happened! Rita: I am racking my brain, but I can’t even begin to imagine why you’d make up something like this. Phil: I’m not making it up. I am  
Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day. I'll be in Punxsutawney for our country's oldest groundhog festival. According to the legend, tomorrow, February 2nd 
Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior year, almost didn’t graduate? Bing, again. Ned Ryerson, I dated your sister Mary Pat a couple of times until you told me not to anymore? Well? #2: Ned Ryerson? #1: BING. #2: Bing. -I thought you hated this town.-Well, it’s beginning to grow on me.-Not bad Mr. Connors. You say this is your first  
In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie. Poor Phil Connors (played with excellent drollness by Bill Murray) was forced to wake up day after day, reliving each run-in with Needlenose Ned, his producer Rita, and his cameraman, Larry. 
Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
Groundhog Day is a popular tradition celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2nd. According to folklore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow and sees its shadow, it predicts six more weeks of winter. One of the most memorable characters from the iconic movie “Groundhog Day” is Ned Ryerson, played by Stephen Tobolowsky. 
This is where the events of the movie "Groundhog Day" take place, where Phil finds himself stuck in a time loop reliving the same day over and over again. The town of Pittsburgh serves as the setting for the film's storyline and is where Phil experiences his repeated days until he learns the lessons needed to break free from the cycle. 
Groundhog Day is routinely heralded as one of the all-time great film comedies, and it is not hard to see why – from script to cast to direction to editing, from inception to execution, this is pretty much a perfect movie. Its basic premise is an intriguing one, although by no means does it automatically guarantee comic gold. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
That's right, Groundhog Day's Devil is, in fact, Ned Ryerson. Needle Nose Ned. The theory suggests that Phil is trapped in Punxsutawney because he insults Ned and turns down his offer of a  
Groundhog Day 2024 was celebrated at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with the Inner Circle beginning their march to Gobbler's Knob at 5:15 a.m. ET on Friday, Feb. 2. 
Basically, the assumption is that Ned has run through 500 times already when Phil starts his Groundhog Day, and Phil's day constantly overwrites Ned's 501st day. This would explain why Ned's actions are slightly different on the days that Phil acts wildly differently. 
At first glance, Groundhog Day seems just like a light comedy, but underneath the surface there’s a lot of wisdom to take from it.  We can say Phil’s adventure really is an emotional  
As the folks in Punxsutawney say, it’s “A day to take everything a little less seriously, and break up the winter monotony at least for a little while!” What is the Meaning Behind Groundhog Day? Imbolc Origins. Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. 
The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication have been meticulously kept. Over the years, Phil has predicted six more  
Okay, just stay with me that Ned is a previous looper. So, let’s jump into Ned’s loop. Not Phil’s. Ned relives the same exact day as Phil but Phil is unaware until it’s his turn. In other words, Phil is on day 1 on repeat while Ned goes through his loops. Ned goes through just as many loops as Phil. Maybe more. </p>
