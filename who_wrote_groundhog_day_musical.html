He played Phil in the original London production, for which he won the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, reprising his role in the Broadway production where he was Tony Nominated for Best Actor in a Musical, and he played Phil again in London for Groundhog Day’s record-breaking return season at the Old Vic in 2023.

Look up Tim Minchin, the guy who wrote the music to Groundhog Day and Matilda. His music is incredible and he puts on a great live show. Most of his stuff are kind of South Park style humor, smart but crass, so it's not as clean as his Broadway work but still really good. White Wine in the Sun is my absolute favorite Christmas song (it's clean)
