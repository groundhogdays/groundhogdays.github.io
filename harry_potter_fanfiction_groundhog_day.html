The beginning of Harry's day was routine, meet Luna, get breakfast, scare the hell out of Ron and Hermione with his odd behavior. After that, Harry broke routine by going to class. "Today," Snape loomed over the first row. "I am going to attempt to drill into your thick skulls . . ." "Shut up you dirty bag of dragon droppings," Harry called out. 
The next time Dumbledore gave the Groundhog Day potion to Harry, he made sure that Ron did not interfere. Of course, things were thrown into chaos when Luna Lovegood accidentally drank some of the potion, on Harry's 200th day of the cycle, but that's another story. 
He watched Potter and Weasley walk down the steps with their dates. Weasley went into the hall and left Potter with his date outside. Granger arrived at the top of the steps, at first she glanced around timidly before appearing fully. Draco watched her face as she started descending the stairs, she caught Potterâ€™s eye and gave a small timid  
The many Deaths of Harry Potter Slightly less like groundhog day in that the loops: last longer than a day have a variable start and end Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. 
Mornings that had once begun with kisses and lovemaking now started with a silent acknowledgement of the dread infiltrating every crevice of their waking lives. The soul-crushing weight of Harry's safety pressing against them both like a leadened shroud. On cue, Harry's cries shattered the precarity of their quietude. 
Groundhog Day â€“ Time Loop. Draco woke at 6:30 am, it was an ordinary day. Thursday the 2nd February, he didn't know that this day would be vastly different to any other day he had at this damn school. He had returned to Hogwarts to repeat his seventh year. He had never had such a boring year at Hogwarts before. 
Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged â€˜You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.â€™Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU Site : Archive of Our Own | Fandom : Harry Potter - J.

Also, there's Wastelands of Time, plus HP &amp; the Temporal Beacon, both of which involve a "groundhog day" like time loop. The former is Harry/Fleur and complete, the latter is H/Hr and abandoned, IIRC. Sorry I have no links, I'm on mobile atm.

Notes: This piece takes place in a Harry Potter 'reality' where entities which are assumed will be eventually responsible for the events of Groundhog Day in a different reality are messing around with one particular Harry Potter universe character. 
Not really a Groundhog Day story. To me, it is yet another DLP-bait, Harry-Potter-is-Wolverine fic. He drinks, he smokes, he fucks, he takes massive damage but gets better. The usual. It doesn't read like a Harry Potter story, more like the massive genre crossover it all but admits to in the author's initial blurb chapter.

She had her eyes on him since first year, much as Draco had. But Draco was realistic and knew that he would be lucky to meet a man, as half as decent, as Potter. Potter was straight, Potter was the saviour, Potter was the exact opposite to Draco in every way. Opposing houses, opposing sides in the war, and even opposing sexuality. 
Not Harry Potter, the movie Groundhog Day, nor anything else that might pop up in this story. Mine are only the spelling errors. Author's Note: The following is set in sixth year. It is completely Ron/Hermione, if you haven't already guessed. Maybe some H/G later on. I hope it's not too stereotypical. 
Yet, Potter wouldn't remember all the hard work and effort Draco had put in. Today he had enough, he waited until Potter once again escaped the common room to hide from Weaslette. Potter was sat in a huge window seat, looking out the window at the sky. Draco stopped in front of him and coughed to make Harry aware that he was there. </p>
