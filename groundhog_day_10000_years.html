        <h2><strong>groundhog day 10000 years groundhog day shadow time</strong></h2>
        <p>Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day‚Äôs time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards‚Äô prediction or Ramis‚Äô original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Groundhog Day infamously sticks Bill Murray in a time loop. It's clear he was there for a long time, but exactly how long?  Initially, the script envisioned a 10,000 year time-loop, but was  
However, in a commentary special feature of the movie, director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the day for 10,000 years before later saying it was probably about 10 years. 
"He said, 'Stephen, I'm a practicing Buddhist, and we believe that it takes 10,000 years to perfect a human soul, and the story of 'Groundhog Day' is the story of the perfection of the human soul. 
Ironically, the 10,000-hour skill-learning estimate ‚Äî which was only ever supposed to be an average ‚Äî comes from a paper published the same year as Groundhog Day, 1993. 
2 February is Groundhog Day ‚Äì when, according to Punxsutawney folklore ‚Äì a groundhog called Punxsutawney Phil predicts the arrival of spring.  Based on the theory that it takes 10,000 hours  
The time loop experienced by Bill Murray‚Äôs character in the classic film Groundhog Day lasted for 10 years,  that Murray‚Äôs character was forced to live the same day for 10,000 years, the  
However originally it was going to be 10,000 years, of forever living the same day without ageing.  Beating Groundhog Day in the top three were Annie Hall and Dr Strangelove, while Some Like It  
In Rubin‚Äôs original script, Murray was looping for 10,000 years, and he marked the time by reading one page in one of the B&amp;B‚Äôs library books every day. 13. THERE IS A PLAQUE COMMEMORATING THE  
The 10,000 years thing in the article apparently comes from Buddhist thinking in which it takes "10,000 years" for a soul to evolve to the next stage. FYI, that probably shouldn't be taken as literally 10,000 years. In ancient Chinese literature, 10,000 seems to be more of a metaphorical conceit meaning "more than you can count" or "everything." 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18] Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years.[9] In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Past Predictions Year Prediction Details 2024 üåº Early spring NO Shadow at 7:26 AM; 36¬∫ with overcast skies. Miranda Moore, 2023 Miss Pennsylvania was the special guest of the Inner Circle [] 
Harold just smiled and said, ‚ÄúWell, Stephen, it‚Äôs 10,000 years.‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúWhy is it 10,000 years?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm a practicing Buddhist, and we believe in Buddhism that it takes 10,000 years to perfect the human soul, and that is the story of ‚ÄòGroundhog Day‚Äô‚Äîthe perfection of the human soul.‚Äù 
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  
Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards,  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
If you actually read the Wiki article, Ramis states that the 10,000 year loop should be understood in a spiritual sense (i.e. Buddhist sense, as Ramis was a Buddhist), but not literally 10,000 years. In DVD commentary, he claims that the loop lasted for 10 years, but later says that he believe 10 years is far too short a time. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Tom Dunkel, explained to WTAJ. ‚ÄúI would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That  
And yet, Harold Ramis‚Äô Groundhog Day, which turns 25 this month, never struggles under the weight of this philosophical heft,  (Ramis‚Äô revised estimate) to 10,000 years  </p>
