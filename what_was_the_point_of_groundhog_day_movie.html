        <h2><strong>what was the point of groundhog day movie groundhog day japanese subtitles</strong></h2>
        <p>Harold Ramis’ 1993 film, Groundhog Day, is a charming and heartwarming comedy about an arrogant egotistical weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has a change of heart over the course  
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
This year is also the 25th anniversary of the movie "Groundhog Day." (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "GROUNDHOG DAY") MURRAY: (As Phil) A thousand people freezing their butts off, waiting to worship a rat. 
The 1993 movie is deeper than you might think.  Groundhog Day as life metaphor: Most of us have at some point been trapped in a situation where no matter what we did, we couldn’t extricate  
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
Groundhog Day marked a transition in Bill Murray's career. In the early '90s, Bill Murray was at the beginning of the end of his "movie star" Hollywood phase, a period lasted for almost the entire 1980s; soon afterGroundhog Day, he would be making one of his first inimitable turns as a character actor, in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. 
“Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold Ramis, Murray’s fellow Ghostbuster and a partner from their Second City days. The film is lovable and sweet. The film is lovable and sweet. If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
A character introduced at point A must eventually end up at point Z, and the rest of the alphabet must be filled with traps that cause the character to evolve. The audience must ultimately acknowledge that the protagonist has been through a lot, but it was worth spending time with them. Groundhog Day is a textbook execution of this formula. 
I’ve made a point of rewatching the film on or about Groundhog Day nearly every year since the movie came out in 1993. “Groundhog Day” stars Bill Murray as a snobby urban weatherman  
Even if you haven’t seen the film you know the basic plot, because the term “Groundhog Day” has entered the vernacular — which alone speaks to its resonance beyond the film itself — as  
Groundhog Day. Movie: Directed by Harold Ramis, Screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis. Inciting Event: After covering Groundhog Day and being stuck in Punxsutawney, Phil wakes again at 6AM to his clock radio playing “I’ve Got You Babe,” the same song (a recurring motif of the film) as the previous day . He realizes it is not a radio  
Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, February 2. Today, of all days, Pittsburgh TV weatherman Phil Connors is about to experience a bizarre phenomenon during the town's annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festival. 
“Groundhog Day” is, probably, one of the most interesting and memorable movies, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It is a comedy directed by Harold Ramis in 1993. The point is that the plot of the film gets better and better each time the viewer watches it. 
Groundhog day with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is on many peoples Top 10 favorite movies of all time. But who knew that the movie has deep philosophical and Christian themes – in fact, it is a very Catholic. The Theology of Groundhog Day The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil–a weatherman who finds himself re-living a single day of his life–Groundhog Day. If you haven’t seen the movie  
Screenplay Genre: Comedy / Fantasy / Romance Movie Time: 101 minutes. Phil Connors (Bill Murray), the weatherman of Pittsburgh Channel 9, goes to Punxsutawney with producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to report February 2: the oldest Groundhog Festival in America. 
The late great Harold Ramis tells the story of Groundhog Day with Andie Macdowell, Stephen Tobolowsky and Bill Murray 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
In Groundhog he starts to use the loop to his advantage to the point of manipulating his love interest, while in Palm the ethics of that sort of thing are addressed and discussed. Also (I know it’s impossible at this point) I wish we could talk about Palm Springs without spoiling the premise because it’s such a satisfying watch when you go  
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.
