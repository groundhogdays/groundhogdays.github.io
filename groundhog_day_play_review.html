        <p>Review. Groundhog Day. 5 out of 5 stars  philandering weatherman Phil is pretty much the role that Bill Murray was born to play. Here, Andy Karl plays the story's anti-hero, and the compelling  
At times, Groundhog Day feels more like a plate-spinning magic trick than a Broadway musical. 9 ‘Groundhog Day’ Broadway Review: Andy Karl, a Star Is Reborn and Reborn 
Groundhog Day makes perfect sense as a stage musical, a form where actions are repeated with variation in the hope of perfection. And of course, it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is  
As per the classic 1993 film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day takes place on a very big day in a very small Pennsylvanian town. Each year on February 2, a large rodent emerges from his burrow  
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
GROUNDHOG DAY opened November 1st and will run through November 17th at First Congregational Church of Long Beach, 241 Cedar Avenue, Long Beach 90802. Performances are Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30 pm and Sundays at 7 pm. Parking is available at the LB Civic Center parking structure at 332 W. Broadway. 
Weatherman Phil Connors is furious at having to travel to Punxsutawney, Philadelphia, to report on the doings of groundhog Phil, whose behaviour on February 2 predicts the weather to come. “There’s nothing more depressing than small town USA/And smaller doesn’t come smaller/Than Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day,” he sings, scornfully. 
Based on the popular 1993 film comedy of the same title, Groundhog Day has music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical) and book by Danny Rubin (who co-scripted the film of the same name  
Operation Mincemeat review: ‘winning’ musical deserves to run and run “Groundhog Day” premiered at the Old Vic in 2016, and went on to win a slew of awards. 
'90s comedy offers witty, sarcastic take on redemption. Read Common Sense Media's Groundhog Day review, age rating, and parents guide. 
A raft of talented singers and dancers inhabit Gobbler's Knob, home to the prognosticating groundhog and the setting of our play. Still, in a significant sense, it is a one-man show. Andy Karl (Phil), injured in previews, works the show in a black knee brace. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Do you ever have deja vu? Didn't you just ask me that? Bill Murray is at his wry, wisecracking best in this riotous romantic comedy about a weatherman caught in a personal time warp on the worst day of his life. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney  
Groundhog Day had its world premiere and enjoyed a critically acclaimed strictly limited 10 week season at The Old Vic Theatre, London, in the summer of 2016.. One of the most ambitious shows ever to have been staged at The Old Vic, previews began on the 15th July. 
Groundhog Day: The Musical opened to rave reviews at the Old Vic Theatre in London in August of 2016 earning Rubin and composer/lyricist Tim Minchin the Oliver Award for Best New Musical. The show opened on Broadway in April of 2017 garnering 7 Tony nominations including Best Musical and Best Book to a Musical. 
Andy Karl plays a cynical television weather reporter in the new musical “Groundhog Day,” which opened Tuesday night at the Old Vic Theater in London. 
Live the events of Groundhog Day over and over again as Phil Connors. Each day in Groundhog Day: The Game, you attempt to play cards quickly and in order without communicating to the other players before time runs out. Help Phil on his journey from cynical weatherman to friendly, local townsfolk by learning skills like playing the piano. 
Groundhog Day is a quirky and fun holiday that gets kids excited about the changing seasons and the famous tradition of predicting the weather. Whether the groundhog sees its shadow or not, you can keep the fun going with Groundhog Day coloring pages for kids. 
Bored with his life, he heads up to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, as he does every year on February 2, to report on the Groundhog Day Festival. To his astonishment, Phil finds himself trapped in a rerun of his most unfavorite day of the year. </p>
