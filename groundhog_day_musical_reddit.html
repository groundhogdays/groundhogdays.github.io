        <p>Groundhog Day was the first musical theatre sheet music book I bought - I figured "If I can play this, I can play anything". I can still only fumble my way through a couple of the songs (Minchin is a musical genius), but I do play through it regularly.

A discussion of all things Groundhog Day the musical. Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin with the book by Danny Rubin. It is based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis. The musical made its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in 2016 and transferred to the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway April 17, 2017 and preview began  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical.Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Groundhog Day, a new musical about a man who must experience the same day over and over until he gets it right, opens August 16 at London's Old Vic Theatre. Based on the popular 1993 film comedy  
“Groundhog Day” is back. Again. The story of a jaded weatherman fated to live the same day over and over began as a beloved movie, then became an award-winning stage musical. On Thursday it opens at London’s Old Vic Theatre, where it first ran seven years ago. For writer Danny Rubin, it’s the latest chapter in the three-decade journey of an idea that changed his life and added a new  
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
At times, Groundhog Day feels more like a plate-spinning magic trick than a Broadway musical. 9 ‘Groundhog Day’ Broadway Review: Andy Karl, a Star Is Reborn and Reborn

Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes.

Also my all time favorite. I always really like comedies that are light on the plot, where it just seems to be 90 minutes of random shit happening. Groundhog Day, Friday, Office Space, Superbad, The Other Guys, etc.

Groundhog Day is coming to Australia next year and I have tickets. It was meant to be me and my husband going, but he’s now not able to make the trip - as it’s in the next state down so it’s at least an overnight stay.

Similar to Groundhog Day, the big turntable could move so an inner turntable could rotate against it and the tower unit on the inner revolve seemed to just move in a straight line downstage while rising on an extruded platform in what looks like an impossible move at first. </p>
