Groundhog Day (1993) Plot Summary &amp; Movie Synopsis: On February 1, PBH TV weatherman Phil Connors assures his viewers, who are situated in Pittsburgh, that they can, without any doubt, stop worrying about a blizzard that will just fall short of hitting Western Pennsylvania. 
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

February 2 is Groundhog Day in the U.S. and Canada, though probably everybody in the world knows about this weather-predicting custom since the movie “Groundhog Day” (“Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier”) with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell came out in 1993.

It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people.

In 1998, a groundhog club leader wearing a $4,000 groundhog suit reported being assaulted by a half-dozen young men.

The movie "Groundhog Day" has become a cultural phenomenon, often referenced in discussions about time loops and repetitive events. The film was added to the United States National Film Registry in 2006 for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." </p>
