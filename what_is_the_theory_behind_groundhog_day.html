        <h2><strong>what is the theory behind groundhog day groundhog day tradition</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
SHAPIRO: The Bill Murray comedy about a weatherman who lives the same day over and over has had staying power. Philosophy classes include "Groundhog Day" in their syllabus. There was even a  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day as economic theory. Thinkstock. In 2006, economist D. W. MacKenzie published an article on “The Economics of Groundhog Day,” noting that the movie “illustrates the importance  
Feb 3 Larry has a memory only of the last loop of Groundhog Day, and also a memory of Feb 1. Thus the Larry of the last Groundhog Day is in memory continuity with Larry before and after that day, and so these Larrys are memory-theory identical. The Larrys of all the other Days are left out in the cold, identity-wise. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Many people gearing up for Groundhog Day, when eyes are on Punxsutawney Phil to learn if six more weeks of winter or an early spring is on the horizon. While Groundhog Day is Feb. 2, celebrations  
Because we are all living the same day over and over again. There’s variance here and there, but each day is a chance, a blank slate, from which to work. The macro’s in the minutiae. Every day we have the same conversations with loved ones. Every day we make dinner, go to work, exercise, read. Or perhaps we don’t. 
life.The spectacle of Groundhog Day is the groundhog’s interaction with its shadow. According to legend, if the groundhog sees its shadow and retreats to its burrow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. On the other hand, if the day is cloudy and the groundhog doesn’t see its shadow, then an early spring is predicted. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
As most weather-minded people know, today (Feb. 2) is Groundhog Day. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, the creature will leave the burrow

Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here. Celebrated at the beginning of February, the day was called Imbolc —a term from Old Irish that is most often translated as “in the belly”—a reference to the soon  
So being forced to live a day over and over is indeed a rare way to gain some perspective on our daily lives, [4] and Groundhog Day’s suggestion, together with Aristotle, is that exercising the virtues leads to happiness because it develops our best potential, our true nature, our path to flourishing and to achieving, realizing, perfecting  
Another “holiday” around the time of Imbolc is Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day has to do with the Sun and whether it shines or not, and whether the groundhog sees its shadow. There are shadow paths that have been found in Britain where, due to a gently downward curvature of the land, a single standing stone casts a shadow that is half a mile long! 
The 1993 film Groundhog Day chronicles the life of Phil Connors. The main character, played by Bill Murray, is a self-absorbed weatherman who is given the work assignment to cover Groundhog Day in  
Darn, I had a similar theory I was waiting to post on Groundhog Day. Oh well, here's my addendum: Phil's actions do not let him escape the time loop. Every timeline in which he survives continues, and in all of those a version of Phil wakes up the next day thinking he's broken free. 
Here’s what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It’s a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again. 
Given that Groundhog day follows the myth that: A groundhog that sees it's shadow will become frightened, seeking shelter from the upcoming chill of 6 more weeks of winter, or; A groundhog that doesn't see it's shadow is certain that a chill is not on its way 
Here's the philosophy behind this classic comedy. There's nothing better for character development than spending 10,000 years trapped in a time loop  Groundhog Day, is a charming and  </p>
