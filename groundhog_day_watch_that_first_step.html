        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) - Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy! 
I first heard this presumably American phrase in the film “Groundhog Day” but I guessed that it was already in existence before that. I have now just heard it on an episode of “Top Cat” called “All That Jazz”, which dates from late 1961.

One movie that I know of that could be the source is “Groundhog Day”. It is said to Bill Murray’s character AFTER he’s stepped off a curb into a pothole full of icy cold water. &lt;&lt;Phil steps in a deep puddle and Ned says: “Watch out, that first step’s a doozy.” &gt;&gt; Exact quote and all. 
In the 1993 movie Groundhog Day Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors encounters Ned Ryerson, an exaggeratedly annoying former high school classmate. After a humorous exchange between the two men, Phil hurriedly heads off, only to step into a giant slush puddle. “Watch out for that first step!” cackles Ryerson. “It’s a doozy.”

Watch out for that first step, it's a doozie. 
The Giant says the line “Watch out for that first step - it’s a lulu” emerging from the crater he creates after taking the bait and plunging thousands of feet to earth. The line in its title form was indeed said by Ned to Phil on the slushy streets of Punxsutawney, PA in “Groundhog Day”.

Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.

However, the year after Groundhog Day, Strasser wrote about an eighth-grader named Jake who is forced to relive the first day of schoolFOREVER. (Really, the first day of school isn’t so bad.
