        <p>The verdict from Punxsutawney Phil is in, and it's going to be spring!  In 1886, according to the Punxsutawney Ground Club, the first Groundhog Day was reported in a newspaper, and the  
Groundhog Day: Punxsutawney Phil Sees No Shadow, Predicts Early Spring. THE VERDICT IS IN. The beloved woodchuck has predicted an early spring on only 20 other occasions since 1877. 
In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local newspaper, Weathers Wags, according to the club. In 1887, the first official pilgrimage to see Phil on Gobbler  
The focus of many was on Gobbler's Knob in tiny Pennsylvania town, Punxsutawney, on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024 as the weather prognosticating groundhog Phil sees, or doesn't see, his shadow. How did all  
Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow in front of thousands of spectators Friday morning at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, part of the annual Groundhog Day tradition celebrated

The Pennsylvania Lottery's mascot is a groundhog named Gus, referred to in commercials as "the second most famous groundhog in Pennsylvania", in deference to Phil. [26] Because the Groundhog Club Inner Circle has trademarked the use of the name "Punxsutawney Phil", no commercial entity may use the name without the permission from the Inner  
The verdict is in! Punxsutawney Phil without shadow for first time since 2020 Punxsutawney Phil returned with his annual prediction for Groundhog Day, and it's an early spring!

The spotlight returns to Gobbler’s Knob in western Pennsylvania this week, when handlers of a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil will announce his verdict — six more weeks of winter or an early  
The tradition of Groundhog Day goes all the way back to 1887. It was first reported by the Punxsutawney Spirit, a local newspaper. The festival celebrates the emergence of a certain groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, from his burrow. 
At the annual Groundhog Day ceremony, Chuck failed to see his shadow after emerging from his cage at the Staten Island Zoo, where city officials — excluding Groundhog Enemy No. 1, Mayor Bill de  
Groundhog Day is here and the verdict is in! Winter is officially here to stay for another six weeks, according to Punxsutawney Phil. If you’re baffled by that statement, we’re here to get you  
Happy Groundhog Day!The verdict is in, and we have six more weeks of Punxsutawney Phil looking absolutely stunning. Season-wise, the news is fine: Spring will apparently arrive early, which is nice but also an unwelcome reminder that the earth is rapidly falling apart. 
Today, we'll be deciding once and for all is Groundhog Day a time travel movie? If you disagree with our verdict, be sure to state your case in the comme 
Groundhog Day is Thursday, and Punxsutawney Phil will reveal whether he thinks there will be an early spring or six more weeks of winter.  Weather conditions can play a role in his verdict  
Groundhog Day is here and the verdict is in! Winter is officially here to stay for another six weeks, according to Punxsutawney Phil. If you’re baffled by that statement, we’re here to get you  
At his side, another man read the verdict of the “forecaster of all forecasters,” written on a scroll. “Glad tidings on this Groundhog Day and early spring is on the way!” he proclaimed  
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. 
Happy Groundhog Day! Or at least it will be if the groundhog delivers the right verdict! Happy Groundhog Day, everyone. If it turns out we’re getting six more weeks of winter, I am definitely going back into hibernation. Today is Groundhog Day, when we anxiously await a long-range weather forecast from a glorified rodent. </p>
