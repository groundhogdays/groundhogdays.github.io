        <p>The phrase took a turn for the formal when it was included in The Oxford Handbook of Military Psychology, which contains a chapter on “Boredom: Groundhog Day as Metaphor for Iraq.” 7  
To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things  
It's February 2nd, and movie fans prepare themselves for Groundhog Day with one of the most deeply philosophical films ever made. 
This year is also the 25th anniversary of the movie "Groundhog Day." (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "GROUNDHOG DAY")  And they all said this movie was clearly a metaphor for the teachings that their group  
Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis, who died this morning at the age of 69, has proven to be one of those movies that gets deeper the more you think about it. According to Ramis, the movie  
Harold Ramis’ 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” is so entertaining, you’ll want to see it again, and again, and again.  Winter is such a great metaphor for the bleakness that precedes rebirth  
Sunday was Groundhog Day. As is my tradition (and should be yours if it isn’t already), I watched Groundhog Day the film, again (BING!). I also watched the DVD extras, which include some fascinating commentary from director Harold Ramis, also of Stripes, Caddyshack, and (Egon in) Ghostbusters fame. Unfortunately, the DVD special features I  
How the movie ‘Groundhog Day’ can put you on a path to a happier life, starting today  Winter is such a great metaphor for the bleakness that precedes rebirth. “I’ll give you a winter  
Ultimately, “Groundhog Day” gives us a lesson in mindfulness. Metaphor for mindlessness? Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day, perhaps for hundreds of years. The original script said 10,000 years, though the director reportedly said it was 10. Either way, that’s a long time to wake up to the same song every morning. 
The entirety of the film Groundhog Day is a metaphor. The metaphor of the film is centered around Buddhism . The main character of the film is a questionable person who is stuck in a time loop, forced to relive the same day over and over again until he changes his ways, ultimately becoming a better person. 
The Groundhog Day Community Note includes chapter-by-chapter summary and analysis, character list, theme list, historical context, author biography and quizzes written by community members like you. Best summary PDF, themes, and quotes. 
The 1993 movie is deeper than you might think.  Again, Groundhog Day as life metaphor: Most of us have at some point been trapped in a situation where no matter what we did, we couldn’t  
5. State a life-lesson you can take from this movie. Suggested Response: Answers will vary. One good response is that life is meaningless and unsatisfying unless people extend themselves to others. 
In Groundhog Day (1993), Murray’s character, Phil Connors, finds that no matter what he does, every morning he wakes up at the same time, in the same bed, in the same hotel, in the same small American town, on the same day (February 2nd, ‘Groundhog Day’). In the subsequent twenty-four hours he is free to do anything he likes, but knows he  
Several pastors sent me excerpts from sermons in which Groundhog Day was the central metaphor. And dozens of committed Christians of all denominations related that it was one of their most  
The movie Groundhog Day is much more than just a romantic comedy; The messages to take from Groundhog Day are profoundly Stoic; The Stoicism of Groundhog Day is particularly helpful during the current pandemic; Groundhog Day Is Not Just Another Romantic Comedy. It’s easy to dismiss the movie as a likeable romantic comedy. 
At first glance, Groundhog Day seems just like a light comedy, but underneath the surface there’s a lot of wisdom to take from it. The joyful way this movie shows us how our perspective towards  
(CNN) — “It’s not true that life is one damn thing after another – it’s one damn thing over and over.” — Edna St. Vincent Millay 
With the silly story of Phil Connors waking up everyday in Punxsutawney, PA, with Sonny and Cher singing “I’ve Got You Babe” on an endless string of February seconds, Groundhog Day entered the lexicon as a way to describe the drudgery and repetition of daily life. But the movie was never simply about the mundane nature of existence. 
But with all that in mind, let’s look at Groundhog Day for a moment. At the start of the movie, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a fairly wretched guy. Not evil. Not cruel. Just arrogant and cynical. Much closer to Nietzsche’s Last Man than his Super-Man (though Bill Murray did play Superman once, and Dan Akroyd played Die Uberman). </p>
