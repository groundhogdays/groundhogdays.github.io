The Woodstock Moose Lodge, 406 Clay St., was used during filming of the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." Though the movie is set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, most of it was filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature.
