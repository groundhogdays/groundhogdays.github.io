        <p>Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow.

I suspect it's the guy who first greets Phil outside his room in the morning (the guy who Phil calls "Pork Chop" on day #2). He's very curious about Phil. He's trying to act natural, but he's poking around to determine Phil's state of mind. He's checking the status of his "experiment." He'll be there to see Phil's progress every day. 
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop. At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and
