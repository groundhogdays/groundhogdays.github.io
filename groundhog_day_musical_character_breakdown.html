CHARACTER BREAKDOWN Phil Connors is a weather forecaster. He is self-obsessed, career -driven, and rude. He doesn’t want to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, thinking it’s beneath him. He becomes trapped in a time loop and lives Groundhog Day on repeat, unsure if he will ever leave Punxsutawney or see the sun again. 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical).

And again It’s marvelously good funand Karl is a magnetic leading man.” The Stage. Mark Shenton says Groundhog Day is “As hilarious as it is bracing.” 
Bottom line: The musical based on the cult 1993 movie, “Groundhog Day”, is a star vehicle for Andy Karl and a graveyard for female representation. Repetition is a fruitful means of expression in the theater; hence the media itself is based on repetition. That said, it seems like the Groundhog Day, a beloved 1993 movie, was made for the stage.
