        <h2><strong>what is groundhog day reddit groundhog day history youtube</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
It's a well-crafted movie with (at the time) a unique premise and it's funny and has a sort of universal message. If you look at any behind the scenes stuff about the writing and the making of the movie, you'll appreciate more the choices they made and how it turned out versus how it could have turned out, aka an average movie. 
Groundhog Day killed Murray and Ramis' friendship and work relationship. A grudge Murray held until Ramis was practically on his death bed. Murray saw it as a philosophical, existential metaphor for humanity while Ramis wanted it to be a straightforward comedy and trying to get every possible laugh he could out of the story. 
The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring. DamianKuzdak/Getty Images Places like Missouri, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate  
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
Groundhog Day evolved from religious and secular traditions aimed at providing hope amidst unpredictability. Despite technological advances, psychologically, we are still beholden to forces  
The first Groundhog Day was celebrated on Feb. 2, 1887, at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney. The holiday has roots in a few different religions, but it took a similar message from each of them. 
3 of 15 | . FILE - The groundhog saw his shadow, Feb. 2, 1954, as the sun peeked through an overcast sky at Washington Park Zoo in Milwaukee, Wis. The arrival of annual Groundhog Day celebrations Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, will draw thousands of people to see celebrity woodchuck Phil at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa. — an event that exploded in popularity after the 1993 Bill Murray movie. 
Also my all time favorite. I always really like comedies that are light on the plot, where it just seems to be 90 minutes of random shit happening. Groundhog Day, Friday, Office Space, Superbad, The Other Guys, etc. 
Groundhog Day is real, in the sense that there is a real holiday and there is a real ceremony. Whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow has no actual bearing on how much longer winter weather lasts, but it's a fun tradition. It has yet to be proven whether Bill Murray actually spent 
Just gave this a rewatch. 30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
I think you kinda missed the point of the movie. Phil is a horrible, immoral person. He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person. 
Groundhog Day film 1993 reddit Just a sub for fans, and for any and all things related to the 1993 Harold Ramis "Groundhog Day" film, starring Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot, Stephen Tobolowsky--and Scooter the Groundhog. 
From what I remember, Groundhog day used to be much more akin to tailgating a college football playoff game. Lots of drinking, college kids, kind of wild, to be honest. I can remember going with my dad as a kid, and one of the guys in the top hats on stage was so completely shitfaced by the time they pulled Phil out that he could barely stand. 
Groundhog Day is awesome, it seems to be all things to all people. Originally I guess it was supposed to be a Buddhist parable. But I saw Charles Murray doing an interview and he had an interesting interpretation of it as being about Aristotelian virtue. The Matrix, even though it spawned some crap ass sequels, actually has a solid BIV premise. 
we watched ground hogs day about 20+ times. we watched it so many times in a row, we had a crazy amount of lines memorized. i still love the movie to this day, and ill go out of my way to watch "new variations" --ps- what if there was a movie about having to watch ground hogs day over and over til you get it right. 
Hahah, but I think if you really think about it, you could always push your boundaries. Just making up the plan can be exciting sometimes. The first day(s) you find a suitable victim. You start thinking, sex, race, age, weight and strength. A young girl would be easy to carry 
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years. </p>
