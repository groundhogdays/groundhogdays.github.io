        <p>The book "Tradition With a Twist" by Blanche Young and her daughter Dalene has good directions for a very scrappy Triple Irish Chain quilt on p. 105. The book is often sold in quilt shops because it's also got directions for the blooming nine patch quilt that's often taught in shop classes. It would make a good pattern for the groundhog day quilt.

Groundhog Day is a North American holiday celebrated annually on February 2nd. The day is associated with the belief that a groundhog — most famously Punxsutawney Phil — can predict the onset of spring. According to tradition, if the groundhog sees its shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter.

Groundhog Day Quilt. If you’ve followed me for a while, you know I’ve long wanted to recreate the quilt that appears behind Bill Murray and Andi McDowell as they leave the Groundhog Day celebration at the end of the classic movie. One way or another, this quilt kept getting put off for other projects, that is until the pandemic. 
In the movie "Groundhog Day" with Bill Murray, there is a quilt in the B&amp;B he stays at that is on the wall in the lobby area; I think it actually has groundhogs on it too! He also sleeps under one in his room.
