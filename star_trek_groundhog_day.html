        <p>18th episode of the 5th season of Star Trek: The Next Generation "Cause and Effect" Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Episode no. Season 5 Episode 18 Directed by Jonathan Frakes Written by Brannon Braga Featured music Dennis McCarthy Production code 218 Original air date March 23, 1992 (1992-03-23) Guest appearances Kelsey Grammer – Morgan Bateson Michelle Forbes – Ro Laren Patti  
The destruction of the Enterprise near a distortion in the space-time continuum causes a temporal causality loop to form, trapping the ship and crew in time and forcing them to relive the events that led to their deaths. The USS Enterprise-D is in dire straits, with the starboard warp nacelle having suffered extreme damage from an impact. As casualty reports flood in and the ship's systems  
For best results, read this article about Star Trek: TNG and Groundhog Day repeatedly, exactly the same way you read it before.  Palm Springs, and the Happy Death Day franchise, Star Trek  
Cause and Effect: Directed by Jonathan Frakes. With Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn. The Enterprise gets caught in a time loop which always has one result: total destruction of the ship itself. 
The trope's namesake-movie famously addressed neither the cause nor nature of Phil Connor's never-ending Groundhog Day. But this is science-fiction, so the explanation is half the fun! As the bridge officers report to deal with the temporal distortion, the tension was palpable for 12-year-old-me: I was about to see how the Enterprise is  
Much later, in 1992, just about a year before Groundhog Day came out, Star Trek: The Next Generation aired an episode called "Cause and Effect," in which the crew is stuck in a loop. There's a  
Groundhog's Day is more a parable about overcoming the banality of the modern world with personal growth and meaningful connections. This episode of TNG was more a mystery episode that dealt with using the scientific method and it highlighted the core trust developed amongst the bridge crew. 
"Cause and Effect" is like the Groundhog Day of Star Trek (it aired a year before Groundhog Day itself was released), and its one of my favorite TNG sci-fi mysteries. It's a time-loop story featuring subtle nuance in its details, intriguing clues, and foreboding atmosphere. It utilizes the characters sensibly. 
The episode centered around a single day repeating itself over and over due to a temporal distortion, and the subsequent attempts by the Star Trek characters to escape the phenomenon. Like Groundhog Day, the conceit of the episode was that the same scenes would play over and over, always ending in the destruction of the USS Enterprise -D before  
But the most challenging thing about the episode was, and it was a scene I wrote and rewrote over and over again, was the scene where Geordi (LaVar Burton) explains just what the hell is going on. That was my first big conference room scene, my first real "technobabble" scene as a Star Trek writer. And it had to be "cool," it couldn't just be  
Warning: contains SPOILERS for Episode 7 of Star Trek: Discovery!. Ain't no party like a Star Trek: Discovery party 'cause a Star Trek: Discovery party has time loops. It also has an uninvited guest: Harcourt Fenton Mudd (Rainn Wilson), the rouge charlatan who was last seen left behind in a Klingon prison ship in episode 5 'Choose Your Pain'. 
Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  before they made the trek to America, they checked to see if a hedgehog saw its shadow, not  
Considering Doctor Who is a show that is heavily reliant on the concept of time travel, it should come as no surprise that it has a Groundhog Day episode of its own. In “Heaven Sent,” the Doctor finds himself trapped in a remote castle on Gallifrey, where he’s relentlessly pursued by a terrifying creature known as the Veil, only to be reborn in a glass chamber every time he’s killed.

What’s strange is that this episode of Star Trek: the Next Generation does a Groundhog Day theme a year before Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day movie comes into play. While there are a lot of GHD plots in various genre and film and TV shows, I think Star Trek’s might be first. Did they get the []
