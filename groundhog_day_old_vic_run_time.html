        <p>The world premiere of Groundhog Day a new musical directed by Old Vic Artistic Director Matthew Warchus.. Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors (Andy Karl), a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the isolated small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when he finds himself caught in a time loop, forced to repeat the same day again and  
Groundhog Day. When the grumpy, arrogant and cynical Pittsburg TV weather man Phil is sent to a remote Pennsylvania town to report on an animal that apparently forecasts the weather, he makes the journey reluctantly. He has already covered the story four times before, and he's sick to death of it. But this time is different. Horribly different.

The critically acclaimed hit show, Groundhog Day, directed by Matthew Warchus, with book by Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tim Minchin will return to The Old Vic from 20 May–12 August 2023. Andy Karl will reprise his Olivier Award-winning role as the cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors in a 12-week run. 
Based on the 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, this is the story of Phil Connors (a terrific performance by Andy Karl), a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Brand new musical Groundhog Day premieres the Old Vic Theatre for a limited 10 week run this summer. Based on the BAFTA Award-winning film of the same name, the musical has been adapted for the stage by the creative team behind Matilda the Musical. Director Matthew Warchus has once again teamed up with expert composer and lyricist Tim Minchin

In 1880, under the ownership of Emma Cons, it became The Royal Victoria Hall And Coffee Tavern and was run on "strict temperance lines"; by this time it was already known as the "Old Vic". With Emma Cons's death in 1912 The Old Vic Theatre passed to her niece Lilian Baylis, who emphasized the Shakespearean repertoire. 
A review of Groundhog Day, the musical version by Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin on at the Old Vic until August 2023. Better than the original! 
There's a sense of deja vu at the Old Vic at the moment but don't worry - you're not stuck in a loop, it's just Groundhog Day returning there after 7 long years. Having fallen in love with the show the first time, I jumped at the chance to relive it again but had I built it up in my head too much or would my response be exactly the same this time. 
It is Groundhog Day for Groundhog Day. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the much-loved 1993 movie first appeared at the Old Vic in 2016, but its subsequent Broadway run was cut short and an

Matilda the Musical’s acclaimed creators Tim Minchin and Matthew Warchus reunite to bring long-rumoured Groundhog Day from screen to stage. Based on the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is an entirely new musical comedy, with original music and lyrics by Minchin. Groundhog Day begins in July at London’s Old Vic Theatre. 
If this production doesn’t end up with a long run in the West End (and it should), it would make a great alternative to the Old Vic’s annual Groundhog Day-like repeat of A Christmas Carol. Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket.
