There's something familiar about Larry the camera guy in Groundhog Day — y'know, beside the fact that you see him do and say the same things on repeat. 
Groundhog Day (1993) Chris Elliott as Larry. [Waking after a night of reading poetry and only chaste sleep with Rita, Phil jumps out of bed, determined to show himself as a new and likable man. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
With the big day (February 2nd) nearly upon us, I thought I would use the opportunity to examine the Small Moment that really stood out to me on a recent revisit of Groundhog Day. It is the moment that, for me, answers the question of what the film is about: what its protagonist really learns, and what we as viewers can learn from it. 
Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time. In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie. 
Sarcastic and jaded weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is tasked with covering Punxsutawney's annual Groundhog Day events. With cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) in tow, he travels to the Western

Larry is Phil’s cameraman accompanying him to the Groundhog Day ceremony. He does little to facilitate the process of redeeming Phil, but is effective at making Phil look better on occasion. Ned Ryerson 
On February 1, self-centered and sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray), news producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog. 
LARRY: Would you be at all interested in seeing the inside of the [weather] van? Nancy declines (goodness—why on earth would she pass up such an amazing opportunity!) and Larry alter runs onstage at the Groundhog Day party to be auctioned off as a bachelor. All he gets is a twenty five-cent bid from an old woman. Poor Larry. Womp womp.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a

The scene where Larry (Chris Elliott) drops a 2 buck tip, and picks the second dollar back up when Nancy isn't looking. 
Feb 3 Larry has a memory only of the last loop of Groundhog Day, and also a memory of Feb 1. Thus the Larry of the last Groundhog Day is in memory continuity with Larry before and after that day, and so these Larrys are memory-theory identical. The Larrys of all the other Days are left out in the cold, identity-wise. 
By Larry McGuire, Of The Spirit; Jan 30, 2025 5 mins ago;  PUNXSUTAWNEY — One of the many events taking place over Groundhog Day weekend is the chili cook-off. 
Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.
