        <p>"Treehouse of Horror XXXI" is the fourth episode of Season 32 (originally produced for Season 31). This year, Homer learns the hard way that voting in elections does matter; the toys Bart once tortured and abused get their revenge; Homer finds a nickel slot machine that brings alternate universe versions of Homer into the current universe; and Lisa is cursed to repeat her ninth birthday.

Live. Die. Repeat Happy Groundhog Day! Halloween's just getting started üéÉ The frights and fun continue on The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XXXV this Sunday on FOX, next day on Hulu! 
Groundhog Day reimagines Punxsutawney as a contemporary version of the sleepy hamlets and simple people that Frank Capra and Preston Sturges celebrated in their classic films of the 1930s and 1940s. Even Needle-Nosed Ned, the insurance agent played by the great Stephen Tobolowsky in the role he will be remembered for, seems like a nice guy.

But Lisa‚Äôs horror-themed Groundhog Day was another great addition to the long history of the ‚ÄúTreehouse‚Äù anthology. Though the temporal loop is most often associated with Bill Murray‚Äôs Groundhog Day, this was more of a parody of 2017s Happy Death Day. Montage included, we get to see Lisa brutally die eight times, each more horrifying  
Groundhog Day has inspired numerous parodies and references in TV shows, including "The Simpsons," "Supernatural," and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." The phrase "Groundhog Day" is now commonly used to describe a situation that feels endlessly repetitive.

Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end. 
Killing animals is the American way. Just think about Groundhog Day. The groundhog doesn't die on Groundhog Day! It does the way I celebrate. And you should see what I do to a bald eagle every fourth of July! Task: "Flush out Bigclaw" (x90). What're you people doing out here? I'm trying to unwind by shooting cans off a fence. Gunplay is my yoga. 
Xena lives again and again the same day, until she finds the way to stop a carnage. It seems that Gabrielle leaves some strange love marks on Xena's neck. The main characters die a few times: Xena once, Gabrielle a pair of times, Joxer at least thrice (once by Xena's Chakram). 
A cultural touchstone of America, Fox‚Äôs The Simpsons has infiltrated pop culture for decades. However, since the rise of the internet, no moment in the long-running animation has been more prominent than Steamed Hams, and one Twitch channel wants it to last forever. 
Considering Doctor Who is a show that is heavily reliant on the concept of time travel, it should come as no surprise that it has a Groundhog Day episode of its own. In ‚ÄúHeaven Sent,‚Äù the Doctor finds himself trapped in a remote castle on Gallifrey, where he‚Äôs relentlessly pursued by a terrifying creature known as the Veil, only to be reborn in a glass chamber every time he‚Äôs killed.

Here‚Äôs what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It‚Äôs a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again. </p>
