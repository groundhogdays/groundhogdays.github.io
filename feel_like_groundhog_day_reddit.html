        <p>Get up, go to work, go home, dinner, either relax/meal prep/gym/friends, bed, do it again. Weekends I’m tired but do lots of stuff, although a quarter of it is always chores/errands. Then vacation maybe a few weeks a year. Feel like a hamster on a wheel some days. Kinda like that one episode of SpongeBob where Squidward moves to squid town. 
I work from home full time and am in grad school part time. I have a great support system but still feel socially isolated with how limited my socialization is right now. I just feel numb and every day feels the same. I am in therapy and otherwise my life is good, every day just feels the same. 
Unfortunately I got sucked in regardless because of boring shit like I need to pay bills. Everyday of my adult life so far feels like Groundhog Day. Wake up, walk dog, go to work, come home, walk dog, dinner, meager time to do projects I want to work on, sleep (late because if I went to bed at a reasonable hour I’d have like two hours to myself). 
When you’ve reconfigured all of your daily activities to fit inside four walls, it’s easy to feel like a rodent on a wheel. IE 11 is not supported. For an optimal experience visit our site on  
I'm 23 I live with my boyfriend(25) and our puppy (10 months). I love them both and I love our house and I'm so lucky to have the life I do. But it feels like every day is groundhog day. We wake up, go to work (from home) then when we finish work we walk the dog and make dinner then clean up 
Well, life sometimes feels stuck just like with the characters in that movie. Learn how to fix that. You might be going through life feeling pretty happy and then all of a sudden, you realize you’ve hit a dead end. Life seems stuckboring, and fairly uneventful. It feels like you are going through the motions just like in that film  
Depression makes everyday feel like groundhog day It feels like everyday is the same, the same battle with myself. Everything might be changing around me but for me I cannot tell the difference between yesterday, last week or even last month. 
Of course, there’s more to it than that but the saying ‘my life feels like groundhog day;’ comes from that film. And if you’ve ever used that phrase yourself, you’ll know exactly what I am talking about. Here are my top 3 tips on how to get yourself out of a rut and get rid of feeling like you’re experiencing Groundhog day. 1. 
We can feel like we’re spinning our wheels. We can feel like we’re just going through the motions. We can feel like we are powerless to change our circumstances. We can feel hopeless. I was there recently. The last bit of 2022 was hard for me. I felt like I was stuck in that loop. There were days I didn’t get out of bed. Days that were a

Because so many just feel like Groundhog Day with how repetitive and predictable the story is every episode. Maybe I'm just missing the nuance and not used to this. I'm new to actually watching anime, I've always been interested but didn't know where to start and was worried about being judged. 
My work day seems to take it out of me and the idea of having to do anything else after feels like torture. I see people with ADHD talk about how hard/challenging jobs help them, but I feel like then I’d have the feeling of “ugh, I’m tired and I don’t wanna go to a hard job” everyday. I don’t know how people do this. 
I love Palm Springs even past the (early) point when you figure out how it’s built upon the Groundhog Day premise  it doesn’t feel like a copycat, just it’s own version, with some significant tonal differences that just make you appreciate both movies more. 
Won't answer because they'll just respond with "toughen up, you wimp"(or at least that's what it sounds like.) Finish eating dish. Go back upstairs. Finish homework whilst listening to depressing music. Try to write. Give up. Shower. Sleep and forget everything about the day. That's what my life feels like right now in the weekdays.

Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
Groundhog Day is easily my favorite movie, and my other favorite movies have a very similar feel. Hook with Robin Williams, and Yes Man with Jim Carrey are really good. It also helps when a funny person is the lead like Bill Murray. 
Trust me after you watch groundhog day for the 6th time in one weekend you feel like your head is spinning. Since the same day happens over and over a few hundred times, watching it six times feels like you watch the same day about a thousand times. It was exhausting 
Just gave this a rewatch. 30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun. </p>
