        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

In many ways, the themes of the "Groundhog Day" movie mirror the enduring appeal of the tradition itself. Just as Bill Murray‘s character learns to find meaning and purpose in the repetition of his daily life, so too do we find comfort and joy in the familiar rituals of Groundhog Day, year after year. Conclusion 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney.

Re-watching Groundhog Day, something jumped out at me: on a number of occasions, Bill Murray's character dies and the movie continues instead of immediately jumping to the next day at 6:00 am.
