APPROPRIATE AGE LEVEL; MORAL/ETHICAL EMPHASIS;  Groundhog Day: the perfect comedy, for ever by Ryan Gilbey, The Guardian, Thursday 7 February 2013; CCSS ANCHOR  
Being forced to live the same day repeatedly, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) learns that there has to be more to life than a meaningless GROUNDHOG DAY. Set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Phil, a TV weatherman, has been sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities and finds himself caught in a time warp. 
For a 90's PG movie the language is exceptionally mild and soft. The comedic suicide scenes are meant to prove a lesson to the main character. They are comedic and exaggerated and actually have an anti-suicide message in that the main character has to re-live Groundhog Day until he becomes a nicer, more decent person. 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. 
Appropriate non-offensive signs related to Phil and celebrating Groundhog Day are permitted. All other signs of any kind are prohibited. Distribution of signs, literature, or pamphlets of any kind is expressly prohibited. 
Like Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors in the classic film, Groundhog Day, in its most secular incarnation, brings hope that we’ll finally get it right. No matter how many times it takes. 
Groundhog Day is a popular North American tradition observed in the United States and Canada on February 2. It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerging from its burrow on this day sees its shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den and winter will persist for six more weeks; but if it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness, spring will

It seemed appropriate to keep this on the light side as Groundhog Day in the U.S. is just an excuse for a fun holiday. Thanks for your comments and votes! Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on February 02, 2012: 
Like so many fun holidays and celebrations, Groundhog Day actually has a connection to a religious holiday known as Candlemas, as well as German immigrants known as Pennsylvania Dutch.

Everyone knows that formal wear is the traditional and appropriate dress for Groundhog Day. Men should be in tuxedos, preferably with tails and should always be accessorized with a fine top hat. The best top hats for Groundhog Day are made of seal skin and fashioned by a haberdasher that lives in a small village outside of Brussels. 
Hope your Groundhog Day is so fantastic, you’ll want to put it on repeat. Happy Groundhog Day. Whatever the marmot’s verdict is, it’s nice to know spring is on the way. For the record, Punxsutawney Phil wasn’t really scared of his shadow today. He was just freezing his tail off and wanted to go back inside. Happy Groundhog Day, everyone! </p>
