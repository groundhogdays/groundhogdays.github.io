Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
February 2, 1886 - The Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper proclaims this date as Pennsylvania's first official Groundhog Day celebration. 1986 - Phil travels to Washington, DC to meet with President  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
The big picture on how much snow, on average, is still to come after Groundhog Day: Most cities in the northern and western U.S. average 10 or more inches of snow from Feb. 3 through spring, as  
It's always 46 days (about 6.5 weeks) from Groundhog day to the Vernal Equinox - the astronomical definition of the start of spring.  2 years 11 months ago.

The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many

We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times.

In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days.
