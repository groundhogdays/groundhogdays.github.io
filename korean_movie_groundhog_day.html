        <h2><strong>korean movie groundhog day bill murray groundhog day 2</strong></h2>
        <p>A Day is a 2017 South Korean mystery thriller film directed by Cho Sun-ho. The film starring Kim Myung-min and Byun Yo-han, revolves around a father who commits an unethical act in an attempt to save his daughter's life. Three years later, his actions return to haunt him, trapping him in an endless time loop. 
One day, he sees his daughter die in an accident in front of him. From that moment, the same day repeats itself and he struggles to find the secret of that day with ambulance driver Lee Min-Chul (Byun Yo-Han). Notes. Filming began June 29, 2016 at Songdo Central Park in Incheon, South Korea and finished September 29, 2016. 
A Day: Directed by Jo Sun-ho. With Kim Myung-min, Byun Yo-han, Shin Hye-sun, Jo Eun-hyung. A mystery drama revolving around a father who commits an unethical act in an attempt to save his daughter's life. 
There are many movies from Groundhog Day (1993) to Happy Death Day (2017) where the protagonist relives the same day again and again. This Korean time-loop movie is based on the same concept but explores the consequences and redemption of an act. 
Ultimately, A Day is a Groundhog Day premise with Hitchcockian twists, and a delectable dollop of the bittersweet that audiences have come to expect from such South Korean stunners as The Handmaiden, Mother, and I Saw The Devil. Even when you get a happy ending in this oeuvre, it’s one edged with brilliant pain. 
A desperate father relives the day of his daughter's death in Cho Sun-ho's time-loop action pic 'A Day.' 
M(a)y Korea 2024 #28 - Wild Card – Any South Korean movie from M(a)y Korea 2024. Progress: 39/31 "Ha-roo" aka "A Day" was well crafted, surprising and quite enjoyable. The plot was actually quite mysterious and surprising, in that the approach was somewhat "different". 
Only South-Korean cinema knows how to pull that off, and still make it believable. Rated 4/5 Stars • Rated 4 out of 5 stars 01/31/23 Full Review Read all reviews A Day 
If you like Groundhog Day but want to see a tension thriller instead this is the movie, it all takes place on the same day trying to stop an accident from happening, but the twist and turns keep pilling up and is just a roller coaster from start to finish. Not one slow moment in the movie.

Bill Murray in Ground Hog Day . Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
In Groundhog Day (1993), Phil Connors, a cynical and egotistical TV weatherman, is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Disdainful of the assignment and the small town, he is eager to leave, but an unexpected snowstorm forces him to stay overnight. 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time. 
Groundhog Day 2. Bill Murray stars in one of the best comedies of the ’90s, reuniting with his co-star from Ghostbusters, Harold Ramis, who directs the movie.It co-stars Andie McDowell and Chris Elliott. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
This carefully curated list brings together the best movies that deliver the magical narrative style reminiscent of Groundhog Day.Each recommendation has been handpicked and then further refined by the enthusiastic votes of Ranker fans like you, ensuring that it resonates with audiences who enjoy the unique blend of humor and existential themes. 
The story revolves around researchers desperately trying to prevent their own deaths, which are recorded in the surveillance camera footage recorded at 11 a.m. the next day. A day (2017) Credit: CGV Arthouse. Like Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, A day is about a time loop 
I used this movie with my intermediate class after going over weather vocabulary. Because Bill Murray is stuck in the same day over and over again, it gives lots of practice to catch words the students may miss the first time (as well as compare and contrast the differences between the scenes). </p>
