Both an entertaining story and a case study for screenwriters, How To Write Groundhog Day includes the original screenplay, notes, scene sketches, and a fun tour of the Hollywood writing process from this popular screenwriting teacher. 
In a recent Guardian article, screenwriter Danny Rubin reflects on writing Groundhog Day: One afternoon back in 1990, I was sitting in a cinema in Los Angeles waiting for the lights to go down. My wife Louise was at home with the baby, so my companion that day was a book about vampires. 
Writing a screenplay “isn’t that hard,” says Danny Rubin, Briggs-Copeland lecturer on English. “It’s only impossible.” In other words, turning out a 120-page script—the standard length for a two-hour feature film, computed at one page per screen minute—isn’t an especially difficult challenge, but writing “one that actually works, that reaches the audience, comes alive

In both that episode and Groundhog Day the loop wasn't a puzzle to be solved (even though Zari  
I’ve only just started reading Danny Rubin’s How to Write Groundhog Day, but it’s promising enough that I think many screenwriters will want to take a look at it this weekend. It’s available on Kindle and Nook, on sale for $9.99 today. 
*Note that some groundhogs did not make predictions every year in the past 20 years. Special Mention: Punxsatawney Phil. Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. 
Write about the same event from different perspectives within the same story. This is a great opportunity to shift the reader’s sympathies, subtly as you go through the story (think: Author Julie Duffy Posted on November 19, 2014 February 2, 2024 Categories Inspiration, Write On Wednesday, Writing Prompts Tags Groundhog Day, routine </p>
