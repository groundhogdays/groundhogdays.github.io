        <h2><strong>groundhog day book how long was he stuck where to watch groundhog day ceremony</strong></h2>
        <p>Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Director and fellow Ghostbuster Harold Ramis originally said he thought Murray's character had been stuck in Punxsutawney for 10 years. However, in 2009 he admitted the estimate was far too short. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Fans of the seasonal comedy classic "Groundhog Day" have wondered for decades how long Phil Conners spent reliving the same day — and there’s still no definitive answer. Columbia Pictures The film’s original commentary claimed Phil Connors was stuck for 10 years. 
"He said, 'Stephen, I'm a practicing Buddhist, and we believe that it takes 10,000 years to perfect a human soul, and the story of 'Groundhog Day' is the story of the perfection of the human soul. 
Many would refer to this as enlightenment. From that perspective, Groundhog Day shows us a glimpse of a man’s life during those 10,000 years. The revelation of the length of time Phil was “stuck”, comes from Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned, during a recent interview with Chris Hardwick on the Nerdist podcast. 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures

These days time loops are basically their own genre. But no one — not a single one — has ever really matched the comedic genius that is 1993’s Groundhog Day. The tale of how weatherman Phil Connors relives his nightmare, yet slowly turns it into a dream, is one I could personally watch again and again while stuck in my own personal time loop. You have some overeating, some irresponsible  
This is one of my favorite movies. I love Bill Murray, very gifted actor. I watched this movie allot as a kid. Never thought about trying to figure out how long he spent in the groundhog day universe. Too much work. This guy didn't mind though. 
In which case, the number of Groundhog Days that Phil looped through could be greatly increased if he wakes up at 6A every morning and it resets at midnight, then at most he can only experience 18 hours per day, meaning he needs to wake up to 5 mornings just to accumulate 4 full days of experience. 
However, in 2009 he admitted the estimate was far too short. He said: "It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years." The site methodically reassessed Groundhog Day looking at three stages of the film.

He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
He knows this apparently, because he's kept track of time by reading one page of a book every day. In the film, though not explicitly mentioned, I believe the timeline is shortened to around 10,000 days. My theory is that each day that Phil has been stuck in this time loop, time continues as normal for everyone else in that world. 
You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". Phil's reaction at the end of the movie is pretty unbelievable anyway. Even if it was decades he probably would've had a total emotional breakdown to finally move past groundhog day. Specially when he couldn't even end it through death. 
Estimates regarding how long Phil is trapped in the time loop vary widely. Director Ramis stated in the DVD commentary that he believes 10 years pass.However, in an e-mail response sent to Heeb magazine, Ramis wrote, "I think the 10-year estimate is too short.

In one iteration of the script he was going to read a word from a book in the library each day, and read the entire library. I always liked this one. As for the actual answer, a lot is never shown. </p>
