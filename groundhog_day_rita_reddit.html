        <p>Just want to say that last night, Feb 2, on my twelth rewatching of this movie (which I also love) but also never completely understood Rita's tone shift, I have some new perspectives that may help you as well. Phil does tell Rita on that last day! 
The way I saw it, some outside force condemned Phil to relive the same day over and over until he became a good person by finding true love. Maybe that same force helped him out by leaving some trace of every day in Rita's subconscious so she could have enough 'feeling' to fall for him voluntarily. There's nothing in the film that hinted at this. 
Groundhog Day film 1993 reddit Just a sub for fans, and for any and all things related to the 1993 Harold Ramis "Groundhog Day" film, starring Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot, Stephen Tobolowsky--and Scooter the Groundhog.

FilmFuns #4: Groundhog Day has one tiny flaw from IsItModern? on Vimeo. As Randall Colburn at The A.V. Club writes : “Andie MacDowell’s Rita  meets Phil on the eve of Groundhog Day. 
Just a theory. I love that so many theories can circulate about this movie. I think it's Rita's loop tooIt's her purpose in the loop to make Phil a better person. 
Groundhog Day from Rita's perspective would make for a fascinating, and somewhat confusing, movie. She knows Phil as a grumpy curmudgeon who hates everyone, doesn't respect his own job, and does everything in his power to avoid socializing with the "hicks" (as he calls them). 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Andie MacDowell’s Rita, for example, meets Phil on the eve of Groundhog Day. Their first encounter—a long car ride to Punxsutawney—confronts her with an egotistical jerk with no desire for  
In Groundhog Day, Phil Conners from Rita's perspective is a downright creep.  r/Sanditon supports the subreddits that are still dark in protest of Reddit's anti

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him. A tertiary point:

The first hint of Rita being behind the time loop is on the third day when Phil is in the diner with her, having ordered just about everything on the menu. After he shoves an entire piece of Strawberry shortcake into his mouth, Rita recites the poem by Sir Walter Scott:

Groundhog Day is my favorite movie. I'm 25 years old so it's barely in my demographic to like, if it all. If you haven't seen that movie it honestly is the perfect movie. It's funny, it has a cool concept, and the concept is executed well. It also has a perfect ending. Groundhog Day is the best movie to me. 
Rita from "Groundhog Day" is a reality-bender Rita is a reality-bender who has no control or knowledge of her powers. It is quickly established that Rita is a woman who is selfless and kind to everyone, so having to work with a man as selfish, arrogant, and quite simply mean as Phil must be absolutely maddening. 
In Groundhog Day (1993), writer/director Harold Ramis included the detail that Rita’s favorite drink is sweet vermouth because that was his wife’s favorite drink in real life. Trivia Archived post. 
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years. </p>
