        <h2><strong>groundhog day creepy reddit groundhog day phrase origin</strong></h2>
        <p>Small things like lighting, music, camera angles, the look on an actor's face etc can make a massive difference as to whether a movie comes across as a horror or a comedy. Given that Groundhog Day was made by some of the finest comic veterans in the industry, I think it's a fair bet to say that it was never meant to be a horror movie. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Since its 1993 release, "Groundhog Day" has burned itself into the pop culture zeitgeist. Its touching story about learning to appreciate the time we have has endeared itself to countless viewers. 
Groundhog Day follows the grumpy, pretentious news anchor Phil Connors (Bill Murray), who dreads the beginning of February every year due to his network’s incessant coverage of the “Groundhog  
Groundhog Day is a comedy, ultimately, because of its ending: Phil, finally, uses time to become a better person. He learns from the past. He comes to care about people in the present. He breaks  
The mask is creepy, and so is the tendency of the killer to just lurk, standing around gently swaying, looking like a menace but not actually doing much beyond, well, wearing a weird mask and  
The comments came pouring in, with Reddit users naming seemingly "romantic" films that are actually filled with uncomfortable age differences, weird stalking behavior, and a whole lot of  
Sounds like you need to see the short film that "inspired" Groundhog Day (the creators of the short say that GD, in fact, outright plagiarized the idea). It's called 12:01 PM . You can watch it here on YouTube. 
Groundhog Day horror movies. by saffronsghost-256-973376 • Created 6 years ago • Modified 8 months ago. NONE take place on GD. They're time loop films because I  
Groundhog Day film 1993 reddit Just a sub for fans, and for any and all things related to the 1993 Harold Ramis "Groundhog Day" film, starring Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot, Stephen Tobolowsky--and Scooter the Groundhog. 
I love the Groundhog Day reference at the end, it gave the movie some more cred imo as it isn't trying to be 100% original and Groundhog Day was 1993 and not, well, a slasher and also because Groundhog Day is 1 of my favorite movies. I've been seeing it every year on Groundhog Day since I was a kid. gets a 9/10 for me. 
Chevy Impala Groundhog Day I’ve started noticing around three to 3:30 AM there’s always a car that drives down my street into the cul-de-sac goes around, then drives back past my house and onto a street perpendicular to my house stops at exactly the same spot kicks it into reverse and then drives down the street away from my house. 
We’ve all known a kid who was hella creepy. Who talked about torture and murder with too much glee. And the only thing stopping them from being terrifying is that they’re a six year old kid. 
[TOMT][HORROR MOVIE][2000s] Man stays in creepy hotel, either keeps waking up in a groundhog day situation or is having repetitive dreams about the hotel, very dreamlike (not 1408) I saw bits of this movie when I was younger while my uncle was watching it and have always wondered what it is. 
Whatever she does on her repeating Groundhog Day requires a roll of quarters. Maybe she's working on coin-op Pac Man the way Phil worked on ice sculpture. I would love a Groundhog Day 2 from the perspective of Doris! 
Also my all time favorite. I always really like comedies that are light on the plot, where it just seems to be 90 minutes of random shit happening. Groundhog Day, Friday, Office Space, Superbad, The Other Guys, etc. 
"Groundhog Day" is basically a movie about a self-obsessed stalker taking 200 days to figure out what the woman he's after actually likes and using that info to get her. Until it's not. Because Phil does get his girl, but that isn't good enough, so the day keeps resetting. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years.
