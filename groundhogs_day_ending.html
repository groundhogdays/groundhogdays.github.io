        <p>Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
Groundhog Day Movie Ending Explained: Unraveling the Time Loop Phenomenon. Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, has become a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences to this day. 
A still from Still from Groundhog Day (1993). Groundhog Day (1993) Movie Ending Explained: How does ‘tomorrow’ arrive? This time, Phil mends his ways and becomes gentler and attentive to others around him. He learns French, takes piano lessons, and learns ice sculpting. He saves other lives around him. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
Exhausted after endlessly spending the same day over and over in debauchery, seduction, and eventual ineffective suicide attempts, Phil changes. Every day he befriends an elderly dying homeless man, catches a boy falling from a tree, performs a lifesaving Heimlich Maneuver, encourages a soon-to-be-married couple having cold feet, etc. 
Well, Groundhog Day, the award-winning 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis, captures that feeling perfectly, but it initially had a very different ending. The critically acclaimed film sees Phil Connors ( Bill Murray ) — a weatherman from Pennsylvania who gets stuck in a never-ending time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop. At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

While I think Groundhog Day made the right changes, this ending sounds like a really fun way to mirror the original opening and voiceover. Also, it's interesting to note the similarities to Palm Springs , which uses a similar dynamic as the driving for the movie. 
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes. 
The Final Day in Groundhog Day

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end. 
Groundhog Day isn't the first movie to experiment with the concept of a time loop.But it undoubtedly is the most influential, so much so that every subsequent time-loop movie would inevitably have  </p>
