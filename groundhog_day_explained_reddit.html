        <p>What makes Groundhog Day different is the device of Phil having the endless opportunity to fully exercise as many options as he can imagine. The movie is less about achieving self-improvement and more about the operation of moral imagination—how we envision our position, our duties, our possibilities—in the progress toward becoming a better  
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Groundhog Day killed Murray and Ramis' friendship and work relationship. A grudge Murray held until Ramis was practically on his death bed. Murray saw it as a philosophical, existential metaphor for humanity while Ramis wanted it to be a straightforward comedy and trying to get every possible laugh he could out of the story. 
The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring. DamianKuzdak/Getty Images Places like Missouri, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  
In 2006, the International Journal of Psychoanalysis printed an essay entitled, “Revisiting Groundhog Day: Cinematic Depiction of Mutative Process,” which explained that the film “shows us a  
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
The next day, Phil wakes up at six in the morning on February 2nd, Groundhog Day, which had already been yesterday. From that moment on, the awareness of the repeated day becomes solely Phil’s experience, as he watches in horror the same events unfold as the day before. No one, including Rita, believes his stories about the unexpectedly  
It's a well-crafted movie with (at the time) a unique premise and it's funny and has a sort of universal message. If you look at any behind the scenes stuff about the writing and the making of the movie, you'll appreciate more the choices they made and how it turned out versus how it could have turned out, aka an average movie. 
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept.

I don't need Prometheus explained, but I did need it explained how characters within the movie seemingly knew facts that weren't stated. Like half way through the movie everyone just suddenly knew what the Alien's motivations were, what the green sludge did, and what the eggs were without much explanation of it. 
So these groundhogs come out and if it's a sunny day (and it sees its shadow) it's a shorter winter and if it's a crappy day (and it doesn't) we get a specific amount (6 weeks) of a longer winter. This is the most widely supported non-religious magical belief I know of. Maybe I'm missing something. 
Groundhog Day has always been one of my favorite comedies. It has a great premise and some of the best character actors in a single film. "Ned, Ned Ryerson"! The movie is such a great comedy I'm always caught off guard by the scenes where the old man dies. It is such a heart tugging collection of moments that never fails to bring a tear to my eye. 
Before I watched this movie, I googled it (to find out the runtime) and saw an article entitled Here's Why Groundhog Day Is The Greatest Movie Ever Made (which I can't even read because it's not available in Europe), so needless to say my expectations were far too high when going into this. 
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. </p>
