In this sense, the movie is a clear indication of the cycle of Reincarnation, albeit one where this individual did not have to be reset continuously inorder to progress. The ending is him literally breaking out of Maya (illusion), as the Hindus say, and leading a wholly Activated, Enlightened existence, without the need of further reincarnations. 
Groundhog Day Movie Ending Explained: At the climax of the film, Phil Connors finally breaks free from the time loop by transforming himself from a self-centered, cynical individual into a compassionate and selfless person. He learns to appreciate the small joys in life, connect with others, and cultivate personal growth. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February

This time, Phil mends his ways and becomes gentler and attentive to others around him. He learns French, takes piano lessons, and learns ice sculpting. He saves other lives around him. 
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
Every day he befriends an elderly dying homeless man, catches a boy falling from a tree, performs a lifesaving Heimlich Maneuver, encourages a soon-to-be-married couple having cold feet, etc. During his busy day, he learns to play the piano and ice sculpt, and falls in love with Rita . 
Well, Groundhog Day, the award-winning 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis, captures that feeling perfectly, but it initially had a very different ending. The critically acclaimed film sees Phil Connors ( Bill Murray ) — a weatherman from Pennsylvania who gets stuck in a never-ending time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop.

Bernardo Britto’s directed, written, and edited feature “Omni Loop” might be the nth iteration of “ Groundhog Day.”Still, there is no question about the wish-fulfillment nature of the premise, as well as a repetitive structure ingrained within the film that allows for character progression through realization. 
Groundhog Day is a textbook execution of this formula. The transformation of Phil Connors, from a rude jerk to a public hero, is a class of its own. Although the entire film is an incredibly funny comedy, its wisdom and simplicity in conveying life’s most important truths should be appreciated. A smart comedy is an extremely difficult genre. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Exhausted after endlessly spending the same day over and over in debauchery, seduction, and eventual ineffective suicide attempts, Phil changes. Every day he befriends an elderly dying homeless man, catches a boy falling from a tree, performs a lifesaving Heimlich Maneuver, encourages a soon-to-be-married couple having cold feet, etc. 
The original ending of the movie Groundhog Day was intended to have Phil and Rita get married and choose to stay in Punxsutawney.
