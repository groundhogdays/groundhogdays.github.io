        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
What does this mean? Yes, I’ve read up on and know what Groundhog Day literally is: a holiday that celebrates a quaint folk tradition of determining the seasons. But I would have thought that a metaphor or an idiom involving the day would give an indeterminate or anticipatory impression, while Jamison’s construction here makes it seem like

An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Many years later, and we’re still looking to Punxsutawney, and, of course, its top groundhog, Phil, to indicate whether or not we should bundle up or pack away the parkas. And The Farmer’s Almanac says Phil is a crisp 130 years old, so he should be a pretty reliable source at this point. 
“If Candlemas Day be fair and bright, Then winter will have another flight, But if it be dark with clouds and rain, Then winter is gone and will not come again." This, of course, is a Middle-ages way of stating that a dark cloudy day on Candlemas would predict a short winter, while a sunny day meant that winter would continue for some time.

Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
Jim Means holds up a sleepy Punxsutawney Phil at daybreak on Feb. 2, 1980. The groundhog's "Inner Circle" dresses the same today.  "Groundhog Day is really a holiday about sex," he adds. 
On Thursday, Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter, but Groundhog Day is about much more than predicting the timeliness of spring. News Today's news 
The legend is simple: the groundhog's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next six weeks, until the start of spring. A sunny day means the groundhog will see his shadow ― this is taken
