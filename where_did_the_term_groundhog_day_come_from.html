        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
“Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks  
This quirky tradition, known as Groundhog Day, has captured the hearts and imaginations of generations. But where did this unusual custom come from, and why has it endured for so long? In this article, we‘ll delve into the rich history of Groundhog Day, exploring its ancient roots, early celebrations, and modern-day significance. 
These people brought the Lichtmess tradition with them and the badger was replaced by the groundhog. Research by Don Yoder, whose 2003 book Groundhog Day is a thorough history of the tradition, indicates that the term “Groundhog Day” was first seen in print in Pennsylvania in 1840. In 1887, a group of men in the Borough of Punxsutawney  
In other (paradoxical) words, a sunny warmer day, a day in which a groundhog (or anyone else) might be reasonably expected to cast a shadow, meant winter would come roaring back, but bad weather  
MACON, Ga. — Groundhog Day has been an annual tradition since the very first celebration was held on Feb. 2nd, 1877 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If the groundhog sees its shadow, there is six  
I remember doing activities in school centered around Groundhog Day and being excited or disappointed when the groundhog did or did not see his shadow. What I did not know back then was there is a complex history surrounding Groundhog Day that is so much more important than whether or not a groundhog does or does not see his shadow. 
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
How did Groundhog Day begin? The first Groundhog Day was celebrated on Feb. 2, 1887, at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney. The holiday has roots in a few different religions, but it took a similar  
Groundhog Day, as we know it, began around 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, but its roots go back hundreds, maybe even thousands of years. Groundhog day has its origins in an ancient Celtic festival called Imbolc, which was held on each year on February 1st. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder.

How did Groundhog Day start? According to the Library of Congress, Groundhog Day traces its history back to an 1840 diary entry by an unnamed Welsh-American storekeeper in Pennsylvania. 
Today all across the US and Canada, many communities celebrate their own version of Groundhog Day. In Canada alone, there are a half dozen places with a Groundhog Day tradition. In French Canada the day is called Jour de la marmotte. “Fred la marmotte of Val-d’Espoir” has been the winter forecaster for the province of Quebec since 2009. 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
He issued this proclamation on, appropriately enough, Groundhog Day, February 2nd. Punxsutawney Phil's fame began to spread, and newspapers from around the globe began to report Punxsutawney Phil's Groundhog Day predictions. Today, over 20,000 fans come to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on Groundhog Day. </p>
