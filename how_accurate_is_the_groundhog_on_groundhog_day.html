        <h2><strong>how accurate is the groundhog on groundhog day groundhog day real estate post</strong></h2>
        <p>NOAA released a study of Groundhog Day predictions and found Punxsutawney Phil to be the 17th most accurate groundhog in the United States. 
Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. A beloved national celebrity, legend has it that he has been prophesying when spring would arrive from his burrow on Gobler’s Knob since 1887. 
Groundhog handler AJ Derume holds Punxsutawney Phil, who saw his shadow, predicting a late spring during the 136th annual Groundhog Day festivities on February 2, 2022 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
yeah, so rightfully so. the day actually originated in pennsylvania and in punxsutawney. groundhog day isn’t just one day for the city’s groundhog club. it’s marked by a multi day celebration that even includes a groundhog ball. and this year will be extra special day for phil, as it’s his first groundhog day as a father here in alabama. 
Phil's accuracy was just 35% f rom 2005 to 2024, according to data compiled by NOAA.  Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. 
If Lander Lil "sees" a shadow on Groundhog Day, then more winter is expected. How Punxsutawney Phil fared Overall, 14 of the groundhogs had 50% accuracy or better. 
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here&amp;#039;s how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
Groundhog Day celebrations around the country. Each year, Phil draws about 20,000 people to the Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler’s Knob in the Pennsylvania Wilds outside of Punxsutawney  
"Even if you flip a coin, you'll still be right close to half of the time. That's a 50% percent accuracy rate. So you'll be better off flipping a coin than going by the groundhog's predictions." Ouch. 
Every Feb. 2, the world's most famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil rises from its burrow in Pennsylvania for Groundhog Day to give the prediction on what type of weather the U.S. could expect to  
The answer - thankfully - is no. Overall, the groundhog is not very accurate, and NOAA said Punxsutawney Phil has "no predictive skill." Of course, even the organizers of the annual Groundhog Day event in western Pennsylvania acknowledge that turning to a large rodent for weather forecasting is mostly a way to break up winter monotony. 
Which groundhog is more accurate? By the numbers: According to a 2022 study by FiveThirtyEight.com , Beau boasts a 63% accuracy rate for predictions from 2012 to 2021, outshining Phil’s 45.5%. 
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here's how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
Here’s how he ranks against his Groundhog Day competitors. Published: Jan. 30, 2025, 1:37 p.m. 7. 1 / 7.  And based on their research, it seems that Phil is not the most accurate groundhog  
Jimmy the Groundhog is based in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, the proclaimed “World Headquarters of the Groundhog.” His annual emergence from the ground on February 2nd foretells the coming of spring. Jimmy has an extremely high accuracy rate on his annual predictions, making him an outstanding leader in meteorological circles. 
The next-best groundhog was General Beauregard Lee from the Dauset Trails Nature Center in Jackson, Georgia with 80% accuracy. Third place belongs to Lander Lil, a bronze statue of a prairie dog  
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here's how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
As Groundhog Day approaches, all eyes are on Phil, but the pressure is on as the famous groundhog has a not-so-great accuracy rate. According to the StormFax Weather Almanac , Phil has an overall  
Groundhog Day falls on Sunday, Feb. 2, and this year will see another crowd of revelers making their way to Punxsutawney to see the big event. As is tradition, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club will
