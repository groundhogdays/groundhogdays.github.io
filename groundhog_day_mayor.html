        <p>The 6’5” mayor was visiting the zoo for Groundhog Day on Feb. 2, 2014, when he ran into trouble wrangling the anxious rodent.  This Groundhog Day disaster has cast a decade-long shadow. 
STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — An annual Groundhog Day ceremony took an unexpected turn with a startling drop. On Feb. 2, 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio accidentally dropped Staten Island Chuck during the  
Staten Island Chuck bit New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009. [3] [4] Over his 12 years as mayor, Bloomberg attended 7 of 12 ceremonies. [5] Chuck was later replaced by his granddaughter, Charlotte, for the first Groundhog Day ceremony held during the mayoralty of Bill de Blasio. During that ceremony held on February 2, 2014, de Blasio  
Ten years ago, New York City lost one of its most treasured rodents. During a Groundhog Day celebration on Feb. 2, 2014, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio failed to get a good grip on Charlotte, the groundhog chosen to play the role of Staten Island Chuck, who wriggled out of his grasp and tumbled headfirst to the ground. 
In the aftermath of the scandal, the Staten Island Zoo announced in January 2015 that it had revised its Groundhog Day policy so that no one – mayor or otherwise – could handle the animals. 3.

The zookeepers had benched Chuck and replaced him with Charlotte for the Groundhog Day ceremony after the nippy male rodent bit de Blasio’s predecessor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg during the photo  
It began on Sunday, February 2, 2014 - a brisk 40-something-degree day with partly cloudy skies, the perfect day for Staten Island Chuck, to determine the outcome of spring. In keeping with tradition, newly elected New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took to the Staten Island Zoo to declare if the legendary groundhog would see its shadow or not. 
What's True. During a Groundhog Day ceremony in 2014, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio accidentally dropped a groundhog. A few days later, that groundhog passed away.
