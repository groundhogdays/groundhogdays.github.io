        <p>Groundhog Day's Time Loop Begins With Ned Ryerson According to the theory, the time loop begins the first time Phil runs into Ned and is intended to get him to sign a contract. They're supposedly friends from high school, but Phil doesn’t recognize him, thinking the man is a fan instead. 
The theory goes that Ned Ryerson is actually the embodiment of the Devil, and that he deliberately traps Phil in the time loop as a form of punishment. It's a brilliantly convincing theory, but it also tarnishes Groundhog Day's happy ending with an incredibly dark subtext. Ned Ryerson Is The Devil In Groundhog Day 
While the "Groundhog Day" theory certainly has some validity, it nevertheless has its fair share of detractors.  "This theory implies that Ned (the devil) didn't give Phil a real choice, which  
As of writing this on February 2, 2024, it’s Groundhog Day, which means it’s a good time to stream the Bill Murray comedy classic.. But I’m here to share a fan theory that blew my mind when  
In a theory that first appeared online in 2017, some fans think that Ryerson’s character actually represents the devil himself. While an insurance salesman representing a demonic entity is not all that revolutionary, the theory becomes more convincing the deeper you dig. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
Groundhog Day sees Ned Ryerson's Devil trap Bill Murray's Phil Connors in a time loop, according to a popular fan theory. By George Simpson , Senior Film and Arts Reporter 11:55, Wed, Jan 1, 2025  
The Groundhog Day theory, suggested by Redditor SuperConductiveRabbi, frames Ned Ryerson as the Devil in the comedy helmed by Harold Ramis. As per the user, the tormenting time-loop Bill Murray ‘s Phil finds himself in, which never gets a concrete explanation, may be a by-product of the first time he encounters Ned. 
According to one theory that was originally posted on Reddit, he's there under the control of the devil, who we actually meet early on in Groundhog Day. You'd be forgiven for missing him too

In this episode of Film Theory, we dive deep into the enigmatic character of Ned Ryerson in the classic film Groundhog Day, and explore the fascinating theor 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
Ok so he's fated to love the producer. But he only has one chance. One day as we all know first impressions matter. But because she's so kind she's willing to give him a day or two to decide. But by the second day she dislikes him more and he's losing his fate His true love forever. And the day ends and he's lost her. 
With his soul in the hand of the Devil, this interpretation makes Groundhog Day far scarier. Groundhog Day (1993) This take on the theory also cements the spiritual symbolism. Ned getting Phil to sign the deal was him swaying Phil into eternal damnation, disguised as sweet heaven. Anybody else getting vibes similar to The Good Place?

The only thing I don't like about the theory is that it's inconsistent with the lore of The Devil/Satan/Lucifer, and the key piece of lore is that he convinces you to willingly choose his deal through enticements. The Devil doesn't put you in an impossible situation where you're left with no choice but to take his deal. 
It is often the case that comedy has a level of darkness to it. Even the most unsuspecting, family-friendly comedy might have an underlying darkness and intrigue in its composition or background. In the case of Bill Murray’s 1990s comedy classic Groundhog Day, for instance, some fans theorise that  </p>
