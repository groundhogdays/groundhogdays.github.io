Review of Groundhog Day in “Philosophy Now” by Mike Faust; Groundhog Day: the perfect comedy, for ever by Ryan Gilbey, The Guardian, Thursday 7 February 2013; CCSS ANCHOR STANDARDS 
Groundhog Day is a wonderful movie. Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas. 
Being forced to live the same day repeatedly, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) learns that there has to be more to life than a meaningless GROUNDHOG DAY. Set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Phil, a TV weatherman, has been sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities and finds himself caught in a time warp.

A Groundhog Club handler holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather-prognosticating groundhog, during the 133rd celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2, 2019. 
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.
