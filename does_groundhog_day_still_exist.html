        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

How Groundhog Day came to the U.S. — and why we still celebrate it 138 years later By Rachel Treisman Published February 2, 2023 at 2:11 AM PST 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Even though Phil Connors’ life resets every February 2 at 6:00 a.m., the movie also shows that for each Groundhog Day he experiences, the world still continues on for everyone else. And that calls into question much deeper issues than most moviesâ€”let alone comediesâ€”ever ask about identity, parallel universes, infinite timelines  
And what does February 2nd have to do with it? But Groundhog Day actually has deep roots in a much older Christian tradition. Furthermore, the day that we celebrate Groundhog's Day has some real meteorological significance, designating the halfway point between two important markers in the changing of the seasons (via EarthSky.) 
In honor of Groundhog Day, I thought it would be fun to take a look back at the 1993 comedy that still makes me laugh every time I see it.

As a child, I liked Groundhog Day just like anyone else does, which was: it was fun but I didn’t really get it. It was interesting to see the fuzzy groundhog and hear the forecast, but I didn’t really understand the logic around the groundhog and the shadow, or how groundhogs got roped into this at all.
