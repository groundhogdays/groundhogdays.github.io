The best bed and breakfasts offer a sense of familiarity that feels like home. At Cherry Tree Inn Bed and Breakfast, that sense of deja vu is expected since it&amp;#039;s the place where Bill Murray woke up over, and over, and over in the movie Groundhog Day. 
We were excited to stay in the lovely Magnolia Suite - aka Phil Connors‚Äô room in Groundhog Day the movie. The house is beautiful and well-preserved. Our hosts George and Lori, directed us to points of interest, provided history of the town and the making of Groundhog Day. They make a delicious breakfast so large that you won‚Äôt need lunch. 
If you‚Äôre looking for a fun thing to do, I‚Äôd recommend doing a self-guided Groundhog Day movie walking tour. All the movie spots have plaques to indicate where it took place. The Cherry Tree Inn has one too!Look for the Groundhog Day plaque on the arch as you walk to the front of the home. Final Thoughts of Cherry Tree Inn
