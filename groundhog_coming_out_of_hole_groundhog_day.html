        <h2><strong>groundhog coming out of hole groundhog day groundhog day book epic</strong></h2>
        <p>Every year on February 2nd, Groundhog’s Day is celebrated around the world. This very day is used to determine if we will have an early spring or six more weeks of winter weather. This decision is made by a Groundhog coming out of his hole to either see his shadow and predict six more weeks of winter or see no shadow for an early spring. 
It's almost time for the iconic groundhog Punxsutawney Phil to come out of hibernation. After a uniquely harsh winter for some parts of the country, people may be hoping that Phil does not see his  
Groundhog Day is observed in the U.S. and Canada on Feb. 2 every year and falls on a Sunday in 2025. Why do we celebrate Groundhog Day? Groundhog Day is more than just a classic movie starring  
Groundhog Day is a tradition that has taken place annually in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since Feb. 2, 1987. A groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, is brought out at sunrise to make a prediction on how the remaining winter will play out. 
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of winter by seeing (or not seeing) his own shadow. According to weather lore: Sees His Shadow: If the plump prognosticator emerges from his hole on a clear day and sees his shadow, he will retreat, and  
Under this theory, if German settlement had been centered further north, Groundhog Day would take place at a later date. [124] However, the observed behavior of groundhogs in central New Jersey was that they mostly come out of their burrows in mid-March, regardless of Groundhog Day weather. [125] 
Little did/do most kids today know that a woodchuck is a groundhog, or that in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2, 1887, a groundhog came out of its hole at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney and began a tradition that has been going strong for the past 136 years even though the reasons why have mostly been forgotten. 
It is the day that the Groundhog comes out of his hole after a long winter sleep to look for his shadow. If he sees it, he regards it as an omen of six more weeks of bad weather and returns to his hole. If the day is cloudy and, hence, shadowless, he takes it as a sign of spring and stays above ground. 
Groundhog Day Announcer: It's six more weeks of winter, it must be! The real reason groundhogs come out of their holes in early February is to look for mates. Mating season is in March, so they  
20 comic strips celebrating groundhog day. Whether Phil calls for an extended winter or not, here are 20 comics to enjoy about groundhogs, shadows, and undeniably silly tradition of expecting a rodent to determine weather patterns. 
Groundhog Day festivities will begin early on February 2. Punxsutawney Phil is expected to reveal his winter prediction around sunrise. The events of the day last throughout the afternoon  
On Groundhog Day, the club holds a "solemn" ceremony as a groundhog, named Phil, is pulled from a "burrow" in front of TV cameras and cheering crowds. The club says Phil has predicted 99 forecasts  
Between 2, and 4 hours after sun up, and right after a rain shower are the best times. Id set up a pop up blind, or other good "hiding place", and wait in the mornings if I were you, unless you can capitalize on a short rain shower to bring them out. Groundhogs come out after the rain because they like to lick the water off the grass. 
11. What time of day is best for calling a groundhog out of its hole? Groundhogs are most active during the early morning and late afternoon, so these may be the best times to attempt to coax them out of their burrow. 12. Will loud noises or vibrations help to call a groundhog out of its hole? 
While plugging holes is a great control technique, groundhogs may dig themselves out and create new holes unless you take extra measures. Luckily, we've got tons of tips for banishing groundhogs before filling holes and how to prevent them from returning, too.

A groundhog will avoid coming out if it is storming or raining outside. An environment like this is dangerous because medium and large predators like the fox may lurk while it rains. This does not mean the groundhog is inactive while waiting for the sun to come back, though: They spend this time expanding their tunnels or maybe venturing out a  
9. How do you stop the groundhogs from chasing people on skis? Take away their skis. 10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13.
