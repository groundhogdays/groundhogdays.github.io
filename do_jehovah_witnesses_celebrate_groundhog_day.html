        <h2><strong>do jehovah witnesses celebrate groundhog day groundhog day coming out</strong></h2>
        <p>The Bible clearly states that the soul can die. (Ezekiel 18:4) Therefore, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not celebrate the holidays listed below, which promote belief in the immortality of the soul: All Souls’ Day (Day of the Dead). This is a day for “commemorating all the faithful departed,” according to the New Catholic Encyclopedia. 
For example, there may be national days of thanksgiving. In some places there may also be a certain day set aside to memorialize a nation’s war dead, or a day to remember the birth of a country or certain prominent presidents, rulers or national heroes. Jehovah’s Witnesses also respectfully refrain from participating in such national holidays. 
“Jehovah’s Witnesses” by Tom Hilton is licensed under CC BY 2.0. Jehovah’s Witnesses are a Christian denomination famous for their dedication to Bible teachings, door-to-door ministry, and different beliefs. Unfortunately, people often misunderstand them and ask awkward questions or statements that may be offensive and rude. 
The major Jehovah's Witnesses holiday memorializes the day when Jesus Christ died comes around  Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate holidays since they hold the belief that holidays violate  
This is because Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that many holidays have pagan origins or encourage materialism and excess. Jehovah’s Witnesses Do Not Celebrate Most Holidays. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not celebrate most mainstream holidays that people are familiar with. Here are some of the major holidays that Jehovah’s Witnesses abstain from: 
The majority of Witnesses do celebrate their wedding anniversaries, but a few abstain from this too, finding it too similar to a birthday celebration. 4 Political/National holidays Jehovah’s Witnesses refrain from celebrating national political holidays such as the Fourth of July, Memorial Day and Veterans Day. 
Since Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas or birthdays (or other celebrations they deem as 'pagan') if this has previously been explained the witness may or may not choose to accept the  
The early Christians did not celebrate Christmas or Easter, nor do true Christians today. The only two birthday celebrations spoken of in the Bible were held by persons who did not worship Jehovah. (Genesis 40:20-22; Mark 6:21, 22, 24-27) The early Christians did not celebrate birthdays. 
Jesus stated: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Matthew 4: 10) Following that admonition, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas, Easter, or May Day, since these holidays are rooted in the worship of gods other than Jehovah. 
Nor do members mark their own birthdays. This lack of religious or secular festivals leaves them without the liturgical calendar with which so many people, religious or not, mark their lives. Instead, the Jehovah’s Witnesses have one annual festival which is of the utmost importance to them, although it is not considered a sacrament. 
In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the 141 things that Jehovah Witnesses are not allowed to do. Jehovah Witnesses have strict rules and regulations that govern their daily lives. These restrictions encompass various aspects of their lives, including military service, medical practices, political participation, entertainment choices, and celebrations. Understanding these beliefs  
Jehovah’s Witnesses refer to the age when a person is of legal age as the ″bloom of youth.″ Dating is only permitted if it is done with the aim of getting married, and as a result, dating is only permitted when the individual is of legal age.Even when they are adults, Jehovah’s Witnesses who are dating are not allowed to be alone with one another and are required to have a chaperone

Link: Jehovah's Witnesses, why do you not celebrate Thanksgiving? (Yahoo Answers) 
The reason siblings day isn't considered a big deal, is because it's not as popular or celebrated as father's day or mother's day. If it became a big deal, and was celebrated as widely as other holidays, you'd probably see a different policy being implemented. 
Jehovah’s Witnesses do not share in religious holidays or other celebrations that displease God. (2 Corinthians 6:14-17; Ephesians 5:10) For example, we do not participate in birthdays or Christmas celebrations, which have non-Christian origins. Nevertheless, we enjoy spending time with family and giving generously to our children. 
If so, do not hesitate to ask one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He or she will be pleased to discuss such matters with you. ^ par. 5 Once a year, Jehovah’s Witnesses gather on the anniversary of the death of Jesus to remember his sacrifice. 
Why Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Observe the Lord’s Supper Differently From the Way Other Religions Do? We adhere strictly to the Bible in our observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, which is also known as “the Lord’s supper,” the Last Supper, and the Memorial of Jesus’ death. 
The Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Teaching on the Sabbath. The official Jehovah’s Witnesses website states that believers are not obliged to keep the Sabbath as seen in the following source: “The Sabbath law applied only to the people subject to the rest of the Law given through Moses. 
Jehovah's Witnesses do not formally celebrate Mother's Day - mostly for the same reasons as stated for Father's Day above. But they also do not celebrate it because Jehovah's Witnesses avoid participating in any celebrations with non-Christian religious origins. 
A Jehovah's Witnesses Convention in Kraków, Poland. Each year, Jehovah's Witnesses hold two one-day "Circuit Assemblies", held in each circuit worldwide.
