        <p>Just in time for Valentine’s Day, “50 First Dates” is a spin on the “Groundhog Day” notion of a day that keeps repeating itself.

50 First Dates is a stale cupcake of tasteless Sandler-movie clichés heavily iced with sweet sentiment.

A harmless feel-good romantic comedy with Adam Sandler on usual form as a bit of a commitment-phobe. That is, until he meets "Lucy" (Drew Barrymore") and he really thinks he has found true love.
