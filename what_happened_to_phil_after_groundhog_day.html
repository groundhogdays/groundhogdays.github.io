Punxsutawney Phil – the legendary groundhog weather watcher – woke up and saw his shadow Thursday morning, calling for six more weeks of winter. Each February 2, on Groundhog Day, the members  
Groundhog Club handler A.J. Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, during the 138th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Feb. 2, 2024. 
If we're being honest, it even defies common sense. The legend is simple: The groundhog's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next six weeks, until the start of spring. 
We’re very lucky we never had to endure a Groundhog Day sequel. There was a video game sequel "Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son": You’re stuck in a time loop as Phil Connors, Jr., back in Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day in this virtual reality game set in the world of the iconic hit movie. 
Will the Groundhog See His Shadow in 2025? According to our weather predictions, February 2, 2025, will bring snow showers and cold weather. We think that when Punxsutawney Phil—that Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Weather Prognosticator Extraordinary— emerges from his burrow (with a little help from his handlers) to make his much-anticipated forecast, he will NOT see his shadow, which
