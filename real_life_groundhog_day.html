The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
A groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil is central to the traditional Groundhog Day celebrations held each year on the 2 nd of February in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It’s said that if Phil emerges from his burrow and is able to see his shadow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. If Phil cannot see his shadow, then spring will arrive early! 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Updated February 2, 2024 at 8:19 AM ET. On Friday morning, thousands of early risers either tuned in or bundled up to watch Punxsutawney Phil emerge from a tree stump and predict the weather. 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
If you've ever wondered why America obsesses over a small hibernating creature every February 2nd, you're not alone. The tradition dates back farther than you might imagine. The celebration of this part of the year goes back thousands of years-- and actually, pre-dates Christianity itself. Let's break down the legends of Groundhog Day. 
The modern Groundhog Day holiday is based on ancient celebrations of the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, prompted by the early signs of spring. But the holiday’s  
A man in his 80s reportedly experienced a rare symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, one that makes a person feel like they are living in real-life Groundhog Day..
