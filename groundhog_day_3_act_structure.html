Inciting Event: After covering Groundhog Day and being stuck in Punxsutawney, Phil wakes again at 6AM to his clock radio playing “I’ve Got You Babe,” the same song (a recurring motif of the film) as the previous day .

A weatherman covering Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, PA, finds every day the same and spends untold iterations falling for and trying romance his new producer. I'm breaking down movies by their three-act structure. What is three-act structure? I explain it here. Note: I break the story down into five-minute blocks to make it easier to 
to measure how much the structure adheres to Syd Field’s adaptation of Aristotle. Assuming that the inciting event of the film is the end of Phil’s first Groundhog Day when the blizzard forces the crew to spend the night in Punxsutawney, that would make the first plot point Phil’s first time reliving Groundhog Day. 
2. LOCK IN (End of Act One) The next morning Phil is woken by the clock radio. He feels something is wrong (18:21): The radio announcers are repeating what they had said yesterday like a recorder. And everybody stands in the exact same spot they were in the day before, talking about Groundhog Day again. Phil asks them what day it is. 
The Narrative Structure of Groundhog Day (1993) and its Parallel to Economic Theory Released to audiences in 1993, Harold Ramis’ Groundhog Day revolutionized a new take on an existing film concept of a repeated time loop the protagonist is stuck in against their will.

(No Three Ghosts of Christmas, no even setting the rules as in Switch or Defending Your Life.) What's curious to me is how the movie doesn't really set up a standard three act structure.

Three act structure screenplay Understanding the 3 Act Structure . The most well-known screenplay tool is the three act structure screenplay. Most other structures accept this tool in some shape or form. It’s much less a structure than a basic storytelling principle. Here is the general idea behind this structure, including the main story  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

She domonstrates that the "three-act structure," a concept widely used by practitioners and media commentators, fails to explain how Hollywood stories are put together.Thompson then demonstrates in detail how classical narrative techniques work in ten box-office and critical successes made since the New Hollywood began in the 1970s: Tootsie

So, I didn't get the entire thing read, but it's a series of case studies, which I read several of. Thompson outlines a four-act narrative structure (in contrast the the usually discussed three-act structure) and then traces it through detailed examination of Hollywood film plots. A great model for narrative analysis. </p>
