        <p>Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
Per IMDB, "On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years." OR "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
For Director Harold Ramis, a "sense" of 10 years. 10 years is long enough for a man to change and learn everything we see him learn. But as the screenwriter says, it's open ended. There is no singular correct answer, it's to the viewer to decide. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Watched this for the first time. (Though it was sad since Murray and Ramis’ friendship fell apart during the making of this movie) But I wonder how long he was stuck in that time loop? Seems like he spent a fair number of time was it 10 years? I also like that they didn’t explain it. It 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
For how long did Phil repeat Groundhog Day according to Reddit? In the classic film Groundhog Day, the character Phil Connors finds himself inexplicably reliving the same day over and over again, prompting viewers to wonder just how long this peculiar time loop lasts. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days.

"I think the 10-year estimate is too short. It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and alloting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years" 
Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years. 
Well it was a bit tricky with groundhog day so I had to watch it many times over in order to figure it out. Trust me after you watch groundhog day for the 6th time in one weekend you feel like your head is spinning. 
Becoming fluent in french takes thousands of hours, but it probably doesn't take nearly that long to learn just enough french to say a poem or appear to be fluent for a brief time. I love this movie, and I love the theories surrounding how long he's actually reliving that day, but I dislike how the 10,000 rule is applied so liberally. 
Danny Rubin’s original script for the film indicated that Murray’s character was forced to live the same day for 10,000 years This factoid turns 'Groundhog Day' into a pure horror movie. Groundhog Day writer reveals how long Bill Murray relived the same day
