        <h2><strong>is groundhog day a rom com history of groundhogs day</strong></h2>
        <p>For many people around the globe, February 2nd is when they celebrate an important ritual – watching Bill Murray berate poor Chris Elliot in Groundhog Day. Recently during one of my many viewings, I hit upon a sudden realization– Groundhog Day just might be the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Sure, I love Annie Hall, Say Anything

1993's Groundhog Day is an enduring comedy classic that audiences still enjoy to this day.

The next day, Phil wakes up at six in the morning on February 2nd, Groundhog Day, which had already been yesterday. From that moment on, the awareness of the repeated day becomes solely Phil’s experience, as he watches in horror the same events unfold as the day before. No one, including Rita, believes his stories about the unexpectedly  
Palm Springs, The Lonely Island’s summery take on the Groundhog Day trope, was the breakout movie of summer 2020 on Hulu. Then, this February, Amazon released The Map of Tiny Perfect Things , another time–loop romance along the vein of coming–of–age teenage love, rather than the cynical angst of single thirtysomethings in Palm Springs . 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.
