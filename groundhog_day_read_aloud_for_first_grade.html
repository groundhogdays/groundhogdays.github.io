Groundhog Day activities and read alouds. First up are these prediction hats. These could be a follow up to a read aloud or to a graphing activity. Students could create the hat that matches their prediction on whether or not they think the groundhog will see his shadow. They could also complete the sentence stem and glue it to their hats. 
As a first grade teacher, I really like to talk about Groundhog Day, do Groundhog Day read alouds, and have the students predict if the groundhog will see his shadow, or not. BUT, if you want to do this, you have to be prepared to start it at the end of January, especially if February 2nd, is on or right after a weekend. 
Groundhog Day Song for Kids – (1 min) The perfect, quick song for young kids to learn (or put onto sentence strips in a pocket chart) with motions to describe what happens if the groundhog sees his shadow – and if he doesn’t. I’d recommend this video just for kindergarten and first grade. Read Aloud Groundhog Day Videos 
When writing my lesson plans, I like to begin with a great read-aloud whenever possible. Reading a story to your class can set the stage for the day and help them understand why they'll be doing groundhog's day activities that day. There are so many fun books you can read but one of my favorite Groundhog Day books is Geoffrey Groundhog Predicts  
Interactive read alouds are an integral part of any reading or literacy program. 2 Read Aloud Planners Include: First Read - The first read will get your students acquainted with the book, allow them to practice their predicting skills, introduce vocabulary, and help them learn the sequence of the story.

Start with a Read-Aloud. Begin the lesson by reading the passages aloud to your class.
