“Happy Death Day,” a horror riff on the “Groundhog Day” model, opens with the Universal logo stopping and restarting, just as the company name is circling the globe.

Small things like lighting, music, camera angles, the look on an actor's face etc can make a massive difference as to whether a movie comes across as a horror or a comedy. Given that Groundhog Day was made by some of the finest comic veterans in the industry, I think it's a fair bet to say that it was never meant to be a horror movie.

Happy Death Day is a 2017 American black comedy slasher film directed by Christopher Landon and written by Scott Lobdell.It stars Jessica Rothe and Israel Broussard..
