But on his way out of town, Phil is caught in a giant blizzard, which he failed to predict, and finds himself stuck in small-town hell. Just when things couldn't  
Groundhog Day could have been a dull one-joke film, but Murray and Ramis make it work by doggedly pursuing the implications of their outlandish premise. Full Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Dec 21  
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature.

Groundhog Day. Directed by: Harold Ramis. Starring: Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell. Genres: Low Fantasy, Romantic Comedy, Time Loop. Rated the #9 best film of 1993, and #662 in the greatest all-time movies (according to RYM users). 
The meta way to review Groundhog Day would be to repeat the same sarcastic, nit-picking paragraph three or four times before softening up and saying aw, heckfire, it's great!-thus breaking the  
“Groundhog Day” stars Bill Muray as an egotistical TV weather man who has been sent to Punxsutawney, PA to cover Groundhog Day (February 2nd). He is rude to everyone he meets and has no human charity whatsoever. After the “first Groundhog Day” Bill Murray goes to sleep and awakens to find that it is the same Groundhog Day all over again  
Bill Murray in Ground Hog Day . Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Being forced to live the same day repeatedly, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) learns that there has to be more to life than a meaningless GROUNDHOG DAY. Set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Phil, a TV weatherman, has been sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities and finds himself caught in a time warp. 
If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." </p>
