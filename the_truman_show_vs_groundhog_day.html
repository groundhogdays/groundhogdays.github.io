        <p>Groundhog Day vs. The Truman Show 5 comments. 7 comments. Rank  Groundhog day is a lot of fun, but the Truman Show has a lot more emotional impactgot to go with  
The downside of Groundhog Day is the lack of connection and relationship growth, a feeling of loneliness and despair, because NOTHING matters and nothing moves forward. However, I think I am creative enough to make the most of this scenario to extend the time it takes to become like an eternal prison. 
It’s all there in three classic films: Groundhog Day (1993), The Truman Show (1998) and Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind (2004). Despite their tonal and stylistic difference, each of these films centres on a character attempting to find meaning in a world out of their control; all feature individuals attempting to come to terms with the

Or The Truman Show? Is Groundhog Day the Most Meaningful Comedy Ever? Or The Truman Show? Last updated on: February 28, 2014 at 12:48 pm  Are you happy to see Groundhog Day at the top of the  
﻿﻿ In this episode, I decipher the philosophical and sometime esoteric underpinnings to two popular 90s films, Groundhog Day and The Truman Show. Surprising perhaps to some, both films exhibit a great deal of philosophical depth and forethought. Curious ethical and metaphysical questions are raised in both, and with The Truman Show in particular. [spreaker [] 
I see your point of view, but I understood the Truman show as a gnostic attack on normalcy--saying that ordinary, decent life was a sham. Needless to say, I didn't like it much. 7 February 2014 at 18:46 Al said I enjoyed reading this treatment of Groundhog Day earlier today. 7 February 2014 at 20:57 Samson J. said 
Would living a Truman Show like scenario be better than living a Groundhog Day like scenario?

You're right, but for the Truman Show the nature of the TV show was slowly unraveled, yes it was known to be a TV show from the start, but details were slowly fed to the viewer, yet I can see how it's not a great example Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow are completely invalid, maybe I got hooked on the time travel somehow 
While not quite as good as The Truman Show, I have a soft spot for The Movie Hero (2003) a film where the main protagonist (Jeremy Sisto) is aware of his "audience." It's sweet; He's a bit insecure so he's trying to keep the story interesting, his parents try to accommodate him, and his therapist is trying to help him. 
The Truman Show - main character does not know his life is broadcast as a TV show Groundhog Day - main character discovers that he is inexplicably living the same day over and over Eternal Sunshine - main character learns that people can be erased from your memory, and he has been erased 
The showrunners decide the Truman show needs more pizzazz or something, so they decide to have Truman live the same day over and over. Essentially this means having the actors repeat the same actions and reset the props for each and every day. How long can they make Truman believe he's trapped in a time loop? 
The movie came out only a year after The Truman Show and was criticized for how similar it was to that earlier film, with suggestions that EDtv was aping the Carrey movie (via RottenTomatoes). However, there is a real intelligence to EDtv and there's much more humor here than in The Truman Show. It also provides another angle of the concept

Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. Doesnt get any better for a premise than that.  "The Truman Show" came out in 1998, but JenniCam went live in 1995,
