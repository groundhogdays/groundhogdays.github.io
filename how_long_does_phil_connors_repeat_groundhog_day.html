        <p>Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Which, in turn, means it's time to ask the question that has sat in the minds of viewers since 1993: How many times does weatherman Phil Connors repeat the same day in his purgatorial Punxsutawney? 
Fans of the seasonal comedy classic "Groundhog Day" have wondered for decades how long Phil Conners spent reliving the same day — and there’s still no definitive answer. Columbia Pictures The film’s original commentary claimed Phil Connors was stuck for 10 years. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
Widely considered to be one of the best comedy movies of all time, "Groundhog Day's" story of weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) struggling to break free from living the same 24-hour period  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395 times. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
Which, in turn, means it's time to ask the question that has sat in the minds of viewers since 1993: How many times does weatherman Phil Connors repeat the same day in his purgatorial Punxsutawney? The question is repeatedly asked, but is not — cannot — be categorically answered. Screenwriter Danny Rubin has one vague answer. 
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
How long was Phil Connors stuck in the loop? A line from an early draft of the Groundhog Day screenplay in which the character of Phil Connors admits to being trapped in a time loop for 10,000 years. 
Death has, after all, meant little to Phil over the course of the film. There are different theories about how long Phil spends in his cycle, from a few years (long enough to learn French, ice sculpture, auto repair and a few musical instruments) to 10,000 years — that’s the figure cited by director and co-writer Harold Ramis and mentioned by Connors himself in one draft of the script.

Fun facts about Groundhog Day (1993): As Murray’s character evolved to be a much better human being, when director Harold Ramis’ would explain a scene, Murry would simply ask “Good Phil or Bad Phil?” so he knew what direction to take with the scene. </p>
