        <p>Rita the deuteragonist, from the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day. She is the love interest of Phil Connors. Rita works with Phil at the start of the movie. Rita is a news producer, while Phil is the weatherman. The two are given an assignment where they have to go to Punxsutawney, PA, and cover the Groundhog Day festival they have there. Although Phil always had a slight crush on Rita, she at first  
Rita : [as Phil kisses Rita over and over discovering that he has finally passed Groundhog Day] Phil, why weren't you like this last night? You just fell asleep. You just fell asleep. Phil : It was the end of a very long day. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Phil (Bill Murray) tries to convince Rita (Andie MacDowell) again by showing that he knows every person in the diner and the details of what is going to happ 
During a series of deja vu dates, Phil (Bill Murray) tries to impress Rita (Andie MacDowell) by learning her interests.Watch Ground Hog Day Now:  
Rita and Phil travel to Punxsutawney, Pa., for the annual Groundhog Day celebration on Feb. 2nd. What Rita doesn’t realize is that this Groundhog Day will continue repeating on a time loop until Phil – the only one who’s aware of the loop – can figure out a way to break it. Personality smart, self-assured, and generous. Rita loves  
Rita rides in the weather van with Phil to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. They argue about whether the Groundhog Festival there is dumb or nice. Rita thinks it's a nice wholesome event for nice wholesome people. Once Phil realizes he's reliving Groundhog Day over and over, he eventually spends his time trying to get Rita into bed. 
Buster is a key figure at the Groundhog Day ceremony and that duty defines him. When one his Groundhog Day becomes too much for Phil to bear, he steals the rodent and Buster pleads for the police to aim for Phil rather than take a chance on hitting the groundhog should shooting break out. Phil later saves Buster from choking to death. 
FilmFuns #4: Groundhog Day has one tiny flaw from IsItModern? on Vimeo. As Randall Colburn at The A.V. Club writes : “Andie MacDowell’s Rita  meets Phil on the eve of Groundhog Day. 
The way I saw it, some outside force condemned Phil to relive the same day over and over until he became a good person by finding true love. Maybe that same force helped him out by leaving some trace of every day in Rita's subconscious so she could have enough 'feeling' to fall for him voluntarily. There's nothing in the film that hinted at this. 
Groundhog Day - What Rita Wants: Phil (Bill Murray) asks Rita (Andie MacDowell) who her perfect man would be, and as she describes his traits, Phil says he f 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
But Rita will never give in to his sarcasm and contempt for normal people. When he criticizes the Groundhog Day festival, Rita simply answers, RITA: It's nice. People like it. PHIL: You are new, aren't you? For Phil, life is about getting ahead no matter how many bridges you have to burn along the way. Rita thinks people should just be nice. 
[Phil kisses Rita over and over, realizing that he has finally passed Groundhog Day] Rita: [smiling] Oh Phil, why weren't you like this last night? You just fell asleep. Phil: It was the end of a very long day. 
Rita, I know it's nuts but I keep reliving the same day o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day-- today. This is the third time. RITA (completely skeptical) Uh-huh. 
Groundhog Day (Original, Musical, Comedy, Broadway) opened in New York City Apr 17, 2017 and played through Sep 17, 2017.  Rita Hanson, Phil Connors and Company 
Groundhog Day has long been one of my very favorite movies.  In the scene below, Phil’s co-worker Rita, played by Andie McDowell, recites a few lines of poetry  
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes. 
In Groundhog Day, Phil Conners from Rita's perspective is a downright creep. One day he is spewing vitriol, and the next he is saying "I know you face so well, I could do it with my eyes closed." 
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. </p>
