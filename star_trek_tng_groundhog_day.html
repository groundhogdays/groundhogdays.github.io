        <p>18th episode of the 5th season of Star Trek: The Next Generation "Cause and Effect" Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Episode no. Season 5 Episode 18 Directed by Jonathan Frakes Written by Brannon Braga Featured music Dennis McCarthy Production code 218 Original air date March 23, 1992 (1992-03-23) Guest appearances Kelsey Grammer – Morgan Bateson Michelle Forbes – Ro Laren Patti  
For best results, read this article about Star Trek: TNG and Groundhog Day repeatedly, exactly the same way you read it before. 
And go anywhere it did, including a brave time-loop episode that helped to give birth popularize the mind-twisting genre, a year before the release of Groundhog Day. In Star Trek TNG season 5, audiences were met with the episode ‘Cause and Effect 
Braga noted that while time loops are often associated with the film Groundhog Day, the episode was written and aired before the movie. (Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, p. 249) The story was still missing some elements. According to Braga, "I came up with the poker game while I was eating pancakes and pouring syrup. I had no idea how it  
What’s strange is that this episode of Star Trek: the Next Generation does a Groundhog Day theme a year before Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day movie comes into play. While there are a lot of GHD plots in various genre and film and TV shows, I think Star Trek’s might be first. Did they get the [] 
Cause and Effect: Directed by Jonathan Frakes. With Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn. The Enterprise gets caught in a time loop which always has one result: total destruction of the ship itself. 
It is often referred to as the Groundhog Day trope after the movie of the same name, which coincidentally was also released in 1992, though this plot device does pre-date the film. The oldest generally accepted example is The Defence of Duffer's Drift , written in 1904 by British Major-General Ernest Dunlop Swinton under the amusing pseudonym  
"Groundhog Day" Loop: In this example, the victims only have a vague sense of deja vu about it. (Note that, while this is often thought of as "the Groundhog Day episode," it actually aired the year before the film Groundhog Day came out.) Hearing Voices: Caused by timelines bleeding over. It's not only mental, either; Crusher manages to make a  
"Cause and Effect" is like the Groundhog Day of Star Trek (it aired a year before Groundhog Day itself was released), and its one of my favorite TNG sci-fi mysteries. It's a time-loop story featuring subtle nuance in its details, intriguing clues, and foreboding atmosphere. It utilizes the characters sensibly. 
Time travel is a constant theme in Star Trek. From The Traveler to slingshotting around the sun, the idea that time and space are mutable is one of the key underpinnings of the Star Trek universe. In this episode, we combine Groundhog Day with Memento, leaving a recurring mystery with a (partial?) memory wipe at each iteration. Except this  
Some interesting additional info about Groundhog day that people might not realize. Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
Much later, in 1992, just about a year before Groundhog Day came out, Star Trek: The Next Generation aired an episode called "Cause and Effect," in which the crew is stuck in a loop. There's a 1973 short story called "12:01 P.M." by Richard A. Lupoff in which a man relives the same hour over and over. 
Decades earlier, The Next Generation popularized this trope in the Season 5 "Cause and Effect." This Star Trek twist on the Groundhog Day premise -- a year before Groundhog Day's premiere -- had the Enterprise caught in a temporal loop with the time-displaced U.S.S. Bozeman, resulting in both ships' cyclical destruction. As the crew members  
Even in the 1990s, "Groundhog Day" was preceded by the Oscar-nominated short movie, "12:01 PM," and the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" season five episode, "Cause and Effect," which aired in 1992. 
The most popular example remains Harold Ramis's Groundhog Day. The concept appears throughout pop culture today, sometimes including groundbreaking innovations like Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah's  
It’s not exactly Groundhog Day style but Remember Me - Star Trek: TNG There’s an intro which shows Dr. Crusher get caught up in a warp bubble but the first time I watched it, I missed that part. All I saw was people disappearing off the Enterprise over and over with no one but Crusher remembering they even existed. 
Much later, in 1992, just about a year before Groundhog Day came out, Star Trek: The Next Generation aired an episode called "Cause and Effect," in which the crew is stuck in a loop. There's a

What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
This well-received episode of TNG sees the Enterprise-D crash and explode several times in a complicated time loop. </p>
