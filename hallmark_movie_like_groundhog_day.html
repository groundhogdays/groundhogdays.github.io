        <p>Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
Why you'll like this movie: Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. Premise: 
Since I remember I watched a Hallmark movie years ago with similar theme, I went to check and got 2 results after some searching: Valentine's Again (2017) - this was "new" to me so I started it right away. I like it, it's cliche but it's actually pretty spot on with how people can be blinded by what they think they want, instead of really

If, like the rest of us, you watched the trailer and believed that this was going to be a mere Groundhog Day rip-off featuring that obnoxious guy from Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you too would be dead wrong. 
The first time I saw "Groundhog Day" I was reminded of a short film called "1201 pm" that I'd seen late one night when I was a teenager. It stars Kurtwood Smith. It's pretty good, they tried to make a feature film later on but I hear it's a turkey, I think the guy who wrote and directed the short also tried to sue the studio that made GD.

You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life. 
Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time. 
Hallmark Channel is known for its Christmas movies, but the network has expanded to Hanukkah-themed features as well.In 2012, Hitched for the Holidays paid homage to several Hanukkah traditions  
Hanukkah Meets 'Groundhog Day' in Hallmark Channel's 'Round and Round'  Hallmark Channel has a new movie celebrating the Festival of Lights.  Once banished conservative outlets like The  
I must admit that I like Hallmark movies. This is a charming movie and it reminds me of the Bill Murray movie, "Groundhog Day" in which he relived that day over and over to get it right. As the trailer and title (I do, I do, I do) from this movie implies, the leading lady gets to relive her wedding day over and over until she gets it right. 
Office worker Barry Thomas is forced to relive the worst day of his life. [11] Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over.

Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
A fairy tale version . nice, like many Hallmark movies. the only sin - the Groundhog day formula. who is used in not the most inspired manner. too many holes. too much pathetic scenes. fake or predictable scenes. childish moral. desire to convince almost with force about the noble message essence. few drops of Cinderella. and , as prize, a not bad chemistry between Nicky Whelan and Greg Waughan . </p>
