        <p>Ultimately, it’s not implausible that Phil Connors could have acquired his Groundhog Day skills in a timeline not much longer that the 10 months of COVID lockdowns that have plagued much of the  
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
These included the 38 "days shown on screen", the 414 "days mentioned" (including the "six months, four to five hours a day" spent throwing playing cards into a hat), and the colossal 11,931 "days  
Some of the days of Phil's journey are shown in the film, including the Groundhog Day, the day he robs the bank, and the many days it takes for him to take Nancy on the perfect date. There are 38  
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days.

A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid

How long was Murray’s character in the time loop and how many Groundhog Days did he relive?  director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the day for 10,000 years before later saying it was  
Phil and the town of Punxsutawney were portrayed in the 1993 film “Groundhog Day.” (It was really filmed in Woodstock, Ill.) Phil appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in 1995. (He did not get a  
Watching the movie, it doesn't feel extremely long. I would estimate at most 100 days. However, I saw some people say that Phil was actually stuck for multiple years, with one person even saying 10,000. 
How can I celebrate 2025 Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney? While there are a handful of local celebrations of the holiday, the most well-known Groundhog Day event takes place on Feb. 2 in Punxsutawney.
