When did Groundhog Day begin? In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time Groundhog Day appeared in the newspaper, according to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club . The following year brought the  
The "Punxsutawney Groundhog Club" was founded in 1886 by a group of groundhog hunters, one of whom was the editor of the town's newspaper and quickly published a proclamation about its local

The marmot has had quite a life meeting famous people, traveling the country and even having a movie made about his special day. Groundhog Day is steeped in tradition that dates back to the 1800s. 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025.

Here's the forecast for Sunday morning: Cloudy conditions and chilly temperatures in the upper-20s are expected in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania when Phil makes his prediction around 7:08 a.m. ET  
Phil : [talking to a sleeping Rita] I think you're the kindest, sweetest, prettiest person I've ever met in my life. 
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow during Groundhog Day celebration at the Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on February 2, 2023. 
Phil Connors commits suicide several times in this American classic, but what purpose does suicide serve his sorrow? Groundhog Day had many people rolling in laughter when it came out in 1993, just 
How did Groundhog Day start? According to the Library of Congress , Groundhog Day traces its history back to an 1840 diary entry by an unnamed Welsh-American storekeeper in Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. Phil lived his life constantly pushing others away, trying to be aloof, above, and fake. He made himself miserable this way, crafting himself a living hell that got worse every day. </p>
