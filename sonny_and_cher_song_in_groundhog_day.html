        <p>It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? 
I Got You Babe - Sonny &amp; Cher("Groundhog Day" - "Ricomincio Da Capo", 1993)YOU CAN BUY THE SOUNDTRACK HERE:  CAN BUY THE MOVIE HERE 
Every alarm clock sequence in Groundhog Day. 
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere. 
Bob Dylan's use of the word "Babe" in his 1964 song "It Ain't Me Babe" gave Sonny Bono the idea to use it in this song. In the 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray, Murray's character is awakened to this song every morning at precisely 6:00 a.m. on the alarm clock in his hotel room. 
Groundhog Day is anchored by uplifting songs that make a complex foundation for a quirky film. Sonny &amp; Cher’s epochal “I Got You Babe” heralds the dawn in the protagonist's eternal holiday, while “Phil’s Piano Solo” represents his fitful transformation from miserly weatherman to lovable humanist. 
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there.

Any doubts Danny Rubin had about his dream project were vanquished by Stephen Sondheim, who said “Groundhog Day” would make a good musical. That was in 2003. By then, Rubin and Harold Ramis  
The Sonny And Cher song, "I Got You Babe," spent 3 weeks at number one in 1965. Certified Gold and was also number 1 in the UK and Canada. It has been a signature song by Sonny And Cher for many years. Written by Sonny himself in a basement. Sonny was 35 years old, and Cher was 19. Sonny was an up-a 
In The Number Ones, I’m reviewing every single #1 single in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, starting with the chart’s beginning, in 1958, and working my way up into the present. 
Bill Murray stars in a new Super Bowl commercial from Jeep, revisiting the world of ‘Groundhog Day’ and featuring the music of Sonny &amp; Cher. 
The brilliance of Groundhog Day is that it manages to put you  right after the closing strains of Sonny and Cher’s relentlessly upbeat “I Got You, Babe,” Murray’s face — and Ramis’s  
In "Groundhog day"? if so, it was Sonny and Cher's "Ive got you babe". Do all 50 states have their own groundhog for Groundhog Day? Every county has it's own groundhog. 
But just like Phil Connors’ endless Feb. 2, the movie never really went away. In fact, it’s just gotten bigger—so big, in fact, that when most people hear the phrase “Groundhog Day,” they’re more liable to think of Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe” than six more weeks of winter. 
In the waning hours of Groundhog Day, I'm reflecting on the movie which bears its name. I didn't get the chance yet to watch it like I normally do this time of year; that must wait for the weekend. However, I can certainly still talk about it through the song that defines it: Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe." 
It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? </p>
