        <h2><strong>why do we say groundhog day groundhog day crafts preschool</strong></h2>
        <p>To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently.

If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
Why, then, do we continue looking to creatures for answers on Feb. 2, year after year after year? (One could say it's almost like the 1993 comedy "Groundhog Day"  or even exactly like that.) 
To-day, of all other days, from time immemorial, is rendered “famousest of all,” from its peculiar name, “groundhog’s day.” It is said that upon the second day of February, the ground-hogs come from their burrows, and, seeing no shadows of themselves , remain out—a sure sign of a commencement of pleasant weather.
