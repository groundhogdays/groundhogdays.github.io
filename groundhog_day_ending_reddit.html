        <h2><strong>groundhog day ending reddit groundhog day loop</strong></h2>
        <p>Literally so true, you would expect the curse to end because of acceptance or something, but it ends because of sheer desperation, with a montage in the last 10 minutes of the movie when he learns the piano and sculpting, its just so out of the blue it feels like the rest of the movie is useless. 
The end of the movie is different from the original script. The original ending (not filmed) was more in line with what you suggest. Some people have commented on a problem with the end. Rita has known Phil for only a day (technically two days if you count their trip in the van.) And she only sees him help people, Phil is quite busy. 
I don't think Groundhog day should be mucked with. Really, sometimes you really nail something and you should leave it the fuck alone. I mean reading that article what I was thinking was, 'Well maybe the writer got the script 90% there and Ramis's instinct on his changes got it the rest of the way'. I mean, it is neat having that knowledge. 
Every year, on February 2, Phil and his team have to travel to the small town of Punxsutawney and report on the annual Groundhog Day. Phill considers this reportage to be beneath him. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

You're right about all this except that I think you're forgetting which was the final Feb. 2. I actually have wondered why the day you refer to wasn't the final day. Everything you said is true, and Rita said it was a "perfect day"; but on the actual final Feb. 2, he did not reveal to her that he was in a loop. 
Well, Groundhog Day, the award-winning 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis, captures that feeling perfectly, but it initially had a very different ending. The critically acclaimed film sees Phil Connors ( Bill Murray ) — a weatherman from Pennsylvania who gets stuck in a never-ending time loop on Groundhog Day.

The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes. 
The original spec script for Groundhog's Day had a surprise ending that never happened on screen From wikipedia : "Rubin [original screenwriter] spent eight weeks working from home on the story; seven making notes to define both the rules and characters and one week actually writing the script. 
I recently rewatched Groundhog Day and had a sudden realization Bill Murray has the bag of stolen money from the armored car when he gets out of the time loop! After he figures out how to steal the money earlier in the movie, he buys cars, clothes, etc. but he also gives the piano instructor $1000 for a lesson. 
We’re very lucky we never had to endure a Groundhog Day sequel. There was a video game sequel "Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son": You’re stuck in a time loop as Phil Connors, Jr., back in Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day in this virtual reality game set in the world of the iconic hit movie. 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. Phil lived his life constantly pushing others away, trying to be aloof, above, and fake. He made himself miserable this way, crafting himself a living hell that got worse every day. 
Groundhog Day killed Murray and Ramis' friendship and work relationship. A grudge Murray held until Ramis was practically on his death bed. Murray saw it as a philosophical, existential metaphor for humanity while Ramis wanted it to be a straightforward comedy and trying to get every possible laugh he could out of the story. 
Fun Fact: Murray is infamous for becoming disenchanted and bored with his films. Ramis knew this and filmed the movie scenes in reverse - the happy ending, with an upbeat bright Murray was filmed first, the dark, sardonic Murray from the beginning of the film was chronologically shot last when Murray was sick of the project. 
In just over an hour and a half, surely we're only given portions of a 10,000 day time loop and for film's sake, we are not shown the darker and more horrible acts that one might find themselves doing when they feel like there is no end, and nothing matters. 
Whilst re-watching the movie, a thought struck me. For the audience who had been on the journey with Phil for his transformation, the end was a cumulation of a long road to realisation. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. </p>
