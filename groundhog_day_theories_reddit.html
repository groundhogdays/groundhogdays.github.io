        <p>He knows this apparently, because he's kept track of time by reading one page of a book every day. In the film, though not explicitly mentioned, I believe the timeline is shortened to around 10,000 days. My theory is that each day that Phil has been stuck in this time loop, time continues as normal for everyone else in that world. 
Groundhog Day is one of my family's Thanksgiving movies (along with Charlie Brown and The Wiz, for whatever reason), so I was thinking about some of the theories associated with the movie, like how he's been living the same day for thousands of years, or how the bartender is a guardian angel type and is coherent while he's reliving those days. 
I just rewatched Groundhog Day (1993) with my wife last night. It's my favorite movie, and though I haven't watched it as much as some people , it's easily the movie I've seen the most times. This time through, I caught something real subtle that seems to be an entire hidden plot line in the film: I'm pretty sure Phil grew up in Punxsutawney  
i always wondered what made the loop end. and i have a theory. most people think the day just resets on 6:00 am. but it does not. everyday 
As of writing this on February 2, 2024, it’s Groundhog Day, which means it’s a good time to stream the Bill Murray comedy classic.. But I’m here to share a fan theory that blew my mind when

Related: Groundhog Day Is A Lot Harder To Watch In 2021. One theory first posted to Reddit assigns greater importance to one of Groundhog Day's supporting characters - Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), the insurance 
The ever-persistent fan theory of Phil Connors' buying insurance to break his Groundhog Day curse adds a layer of meta-commentary to a movie that already has so much to say. 
Groundhog Day never really ends, it’s a parasite that gets passed from person to person. That’s my theory. Let Me explain: There’s a theory on reddit that Phil Connors is in hell/purgatory and that Ned Ryerson is/was the devil (need link). This video covers that idea but doesn’t link the post. I remember reading it years ago here too. 
Yesterday, marked Groundhog Day and a new fan theory about Bill Murray’s comedy classic has proven to be very popular on Reddit. Why Phil Connors was trapped in a time loop living the same day  
My sister and I annually watch this movie on Grounds Hogs day, and we always think that the bartender is in on it. My theory is that Phil is a looper, but I believe that the Bartender is someone who is aware of the loops, and is able to tell every time a loop occurs in which Phil interacts with him, hence the smirk. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. First and foremost: 
In my theory the first interaction with the alarm clock is just the start of a normal day. Had he not interacted with Ned he never would've experienced that moment with the alarm clock again. So I'm saying on the first day Ned damns Phil to continually start that day over and over, and he takes his first step into his cursed life. 
Re-watching Groundhog Day, something jumped out at me: on a number of occasions, Bill Murray's character dies and the movie continues instead of immediately jumping to the next day at 6:00 am. The first time is after Bill Murray drives off the cliff with the groundhog, the camera cuts to Larry and Rita for a few seconds.

I originally posted this a year ago today (): First and foremost: When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! 
The guy, at a minimum spent like 30 years in a loop and before the loop he was like what, 50? Every day doing the same thing for 30 years, I wouldn't be surprised if he can't remember the first day or the day before or his colleagues names at work. 
Life has gotten to a point where everybody does their daily grind, doing the same thing over and over, only to have to do it again the next day. Groundhog Day teaches Phil that you have to take life as it comes but in gaining an understanding of the people around you and being a better person to those people you can escape the monotony and have  
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. </p>
