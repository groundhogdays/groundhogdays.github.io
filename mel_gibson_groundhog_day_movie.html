        <p>In September 2012, Carnahan posted screen tests that he had filmed with actor Frank Grillo on Twitter, saying he was sharing them "to show you how cool this movie could have been" [8] In November 2017, it was reported that Grillo and Mel Gibson were negotiating to star in the film, now titled Boss Level, with Carnahan writing and directing. [9] 
The problem is that some of the actors seem to be in different movies. Mel Gibson is hammy, rather than terrifying; Naomi Watts is doing sexy-serious-scientist in stilettos, in a role that makes  
The movie, directed by the stylish genre trickster Joe Carnahan (“The A-Team”), is “Groundhog Day” redone as an action revenge movie, and by the time you’re a quarter of the way into it  
Pulver is forced to relive the day of his murder, and must uncover the clues behind a secret government project, led by evil mastermind Colonel Clive Ventor (played by Oscar-winning actor Mel Gibson). 
The fact that Mel Gibson can sometimes put his ego aside and deliver what’s required on screen was also no secret to me. Having seen Groundhog Day and its sci-fi adaptations like Source Code and Edge of Tomorrow multiple times, the time-loop plot wasn’t new to me either. 
Mel Gibson traps Frank Grillo in a Groundhog Day-like death loop in the first trailer for the violent, over-the-top action film, Boss Level. By Ross Bonaime | Updated 6 months ago The last few years have been full of entertainment featuring people stuck in time loops, from the horror of Happy Death Day , to the charming comedy of last year’s  
At first, “Boss Level” seems as familiar and derivative as it is unnecessary – basically just an insanely-violent version of “Groundhog Day.” Stick with it, though, and the Hulu movie  
The project eventually morphed into Boss Level once Grillo and co-star Mel Gibson boarded in 2017, with Carnahan writing and directing. "I thought it was very inventive and smart," Carnahan said  
The film, which premieres on Hulu in early March, stars Frank Grillo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) as Roy Pulver, a man stuck in a Groundhog Day-style time loop. Every single day, he's hunted down and killed by assassins hired by the shady Colonel Ventor ( Mel Gibson ). 
David Crow Nov 16, 2017 Mel Gibson and Frank Grillo will star in Boss Level, a new time-loop thriller from the director of The Grey. Last month, Blumhouse and Universal’s Happy Death Day successfully retrofitted the ever-growing subgenre of Groundhog Day-adjacent films to the slasher movie form. 
Mel Gibson's ability to read women's minds prompts a journey of self-discovery and improvement, blending humor and introspection in a manner that aligns with the tone of Groundhog Day. Premise: Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) gets a whole new outlook on life when a fluke accident gives him the ability to read women's minds. 
Here are our favorite time loop movies that are similar to Groundhog Day and good enough to be worth watching!  Mel Gibson, Naomi Watts. Action, Adventure, Comedy  
The movie is quick, with a video game culture in it, funny, with quantum-mechanics paradoxes, and somehow Grillo managed to support the whole project appropriately. Also Mel Gibson matured pretty well having some great lines in the movie regarding the horror of Violence and War (reminding Colonel Kurzt). 9/10. It could be 10/10 but it had a  
The movie, scripted by Chris Borey and Eddie Borey (who have some other tricksy thrillers on their filmo) and given a polish by Caranahan, really does play like “Groundhog Day” meets “Edge of Tomorrow” meets “Smokin’ Aces” and “Smokin’ Aces 2” meets “Ready Player One” meets “Mortal Kombat” (the game), although maybe  
The movie does have the " groundhog day " storyline, BUT this is SO MUCH FUNNIER and great action. I think " Frank Grillo " is great, funny how I really never remember seeing him as a lead man before. And " Mel Gibson " us fantastic as the bad guy. I really like Naomi Watts as a scientist and a mom. MICHELLE YEOH has a great part too.
