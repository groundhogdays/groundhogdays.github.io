        <p>The world premiere of Groundhog Day a new musical directed by Old Vic Artistic Director Matthew Warchus.. Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors (Andy Karl), a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the isolated small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when he finds himself caught in a time loop, forced to repeat the same day again and  
The Old Vic Theatre Trust 2000 is a registered charity no. 1072590. Limited company registration no. 3667822. Registered offices: 103 The Cut, London, SE1 8NB 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Groundhog Day will be performed at the Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August, with a press performance on 8 June. The show has received critical acclaim during its initial run, being described by Sarah Crompton as “a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving.” 
Groundhog Day. When the grumpy, arrogant and cynical Pittsburg TV weather man Phil is sent to a remote Pennsylvania town to report on an animal that apparently forecasts the weather, he makes the journey reluctantly. He has already covered the story four times before, and he's sick to death of it. But this time is different. Horribly different. 
The Old Vic has announced the full cast and creative team for the eagerly anticipated encore season of the smash hit stage musical version of Groundhog Day.. As previously announced US actor Andy Karl will reprise his Olivier Award-winning performance as cynical weatherman Phil Connors in the production which will begin performances in London on 20 May. 
Warchus brings Groundhog Day to the Old Vic as part of his inaugural season as Artistic Director, with performances due to begin in July, playing until September 17th 2016. Don’t miss out on this entirely original, exciting new musical! Child Friendly. Groundhog Day is packed with plenty of laughs, but may not be suitable for very young children. 
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders.

Groundhog Day Musical, Old Vic Theatre 2016 review: ★★★★★ Back off Broadway, we might just have the best new musical since Hamilton – right here in London. A new day has dawned for hit 1993 film Groundhog Day. It brings a songbook bursting with instant classics and even a touch of tap dancing. 
Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage.
