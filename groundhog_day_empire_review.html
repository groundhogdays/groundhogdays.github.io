Groundhog Day is an undisputed masterpiece - read Empire's essay on the classic Bill Murray comedy.  Reviews. News. Features. TV. Gaming. Podcasts. Empire VIP. 
The movie Groundhog Day was released in 1993, staring Bill Murray. It is also one of the most memorable movies that “never gets old”, according to Empire. This movie is about a TV weatherman who is sent out on location to report the annual Groundhog Day. 
“Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold Ramis, Murray’s fellow Ghostbuster and a partner from their Second City days. The film is lovable and sweet. The film is lovable and sweet. If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
Rated 4.5/5 Stars • Rated 4.5 out of 5 stars 11/28/24 Full Review Simeng C Movie Review for Groundhog Day Groundhog Day (1993) was a romcom film with a bit fantasy setting. It is the pioneer of  
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
In Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. 
When Stephen Sondheim explained why he gave up on thoughts of writing a stage version of that transcendently witty film, Groundhog Day, he went to the heart of the matter: “It cannot be improved. 
The next day, Phil wakes up at six in the morning on February 2nd, Groundhog Day, which had already been yesterday. From that moment on, the awareness of the repeated day becomes solely Phil’s experience, as he watches in horror the same events unfold as the day before. No one, including Rita, believes his stories about the unexpectedly  
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
'90s comedy offers witty, sarcastic take on redemption. Read Common Sense Media's Groundhog Day review, age rating, and parents guide. 
Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage. 
Just as Groundhog Day ventured into more philosophical territory than its poster implied, so this uses its set-up to inject some real emotion into the tale. Sometimes bleak — Nyles has been

Tunnel will make his annual prediction Sunday as Two Rivers Wildlife Park hosts its daylong annual Groundhog Day celebration from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. The Huntington wildlife park’s resident rodent will emerge from his burrow at 11:22 a.m. According to tradition, if he doesn’t see his shadow we’re in for an early spring. 
Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. But on his way out of town, Phil is caught in a giant blizzard, which he failed to predict, and finds himself stuck in small-town hell. Just when things couldn't
