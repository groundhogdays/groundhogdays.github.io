Groundhog Day will be performed at the Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August, with a press performance on 8 June. The show has received critical acclaim during its initial run, being described by Sarah Crompton as “a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving.”

Groundhog Day is playing at Old Vic Theatre in London and opens on 26 May 2023. How long does Groundhog Day run for? The running time of Groundhog Day is 2 hours 35 minutes with intermission.

Karl won an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, and earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. The first “Groundhog Day” celebration of its kind took place at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on 2 Feb. 1887.
