        <h2><strong>groundhog day how long is he stuck groundhog day bande annonce</strong></h2>
        <p>According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
One Writer Finally Deciphers The Groundhog Day Timeline. On February 2, 2011, former editor and COO of WhatCulture, Simon Gallagher, wrote a more in-depth article analyzing Groundhog Day’s events and pieced together his own timeline. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
"He said, 'Stephen, I'm a practicing Buddhist, and we believe that it takes 10,000 years to perfect a human soul, and the story of 'Groundhog Day' is the story of the perfection of the human soul. 
Director and fellow Ghostbuster Harold Ramis originally said he thought Murray's character had been stuck in Punxsutawney for 10 years. However, in 2009 he admitted the estimate was far too short. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures According to Whatculture.com , Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. [9] 
PHIL : As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.-25- He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then he closes his eyes and quickly  
In which case, the number of Groundhog Days that Phil looped through could be greatly increased if he wakes up at 6A every morning and it resets at midnight, then at most he can only experience 18 hours per day, meaning he needs to wake up to 5 mornings just to accumulate 4 full days of experience. 
You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". Phil's reaction at the end of the movie is pretty unbelievable anyway. Even if it was decades he probably would've had a total emotional breakdown to finally move past groundhog day. Specially when he couldn't even end it through death. 
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
However, in 2009 he admitted the estimate was far too short. He said: "It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years." The site methodically reassessed Groundhog Day looking at three stages of the film. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. </p>
