        <h2><strong>groundhog day how long was he trapped the myth of groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>This brings us back to the original question: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? Originally, the film's director, Harold Ramis, stated that he thought Bill's character was trapped in Punxsutawney for about 10 years. In 2009, however, he revealed that estimate was probably too short. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
“Groundhog Day” actor Stephen Tobolowsky says Harold Ramis gave him a mind-boggling amount of time that Bill Murray’s Phil was trapped in a time loop.  to how long it was," Tobolowsky  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures

The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395 times. 
Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. Not knowing how long Phil was trapped is part of the movie's message - the days are meant to blend together for both Phil and the audience. 
Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. 
He does seam to know what every person in the territory at the end. Personly I would say ~9 years seam like a short amount of time if he also would have to have time for the little things, like surfing the web (-: just walking around doing nothing, etc.. 20-30 years sound to me like a good option if we assume he's a normal man who a lot of the time really don't see a point in doing any thing  
"According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Do you know how long Bill Murray’s character was trapped in Groundhog Day? By Stephen Schleicher June 7, 2015 Updated: February 2, 2016 4 Comments 2 Mins Read When you kick back to watch the movie Groundhog Day, one imagines Phil (played by Bill Murray) trapped in a repeating loop for a little over a month. 
However, in 2009 he admitted the estimate was far too short. He said: "It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years." The site methodically reassessed Groundhog Day looking at three stages of the film.
