It's February 2nd, and movie fans prepare themselves for Groundhog Day with one of the most deeply philosophical films ever made. 
SHAPIRO: The Bill Murray comedy about a weatherman who lives the same day over and over has had staying power. Philosophy classes include "Groundhog Day" in their syllabus. There was even a  
In Groundhog Day (1993), Murray’s character, Phil Connors, finds that no matter what he does, every morning he wakes up at the same time, in the same bed, in the same hotel, in the same small American town, on the same day (February 2nd, ‘Groundhog Day’).

He notes that the movie starts with Nietzsche’s idea of the eternal return [2] as a prompt about reflecting on our life and whether it is good  
You can listen to Hugh Breakey discuss the ethics and philosophy of “Groundhog Day” with Waleed Aly and Scott Stephens on The Minefield.. It would have been easy for an innocent audience  
The Ethics of Groundhog Day: Phil Connors and the Platonic Tripartite Division of the Soul Rachel Cedor Course: Philosophy 313 Instructor: Brooke Ettle In the film Groundhog Day, the character of Phil Connors is forced to relive the same day, February 2, over and over again.

In his book, How to Write Groundhog Day (2012), screenwriter Danny Rubin tells us, “The first note [after the film premiered] I remember came from a monk in Germany.

Character Analysis Sarcastic Jerk. From the moment we meet Phil Connors, we can tell he's a jerk. Sure, he has to act charming professionally (because he's a weatherman), but once he's off camera, we see just how much contempt he has for the world around him.
