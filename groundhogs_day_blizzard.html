        <h2><strong>groundhogs day blizzard clock from groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>The 2011 Groundhog Day blizzard [3] [4] [5] was a powerful and historic winter storm that affected large swaths of the United States and Canada from January 31 to February 2, 2011, especially on Groundhog Day. 
Below is an article that was written in February 2011 providing additional context on the 2011 Groundhog Day Blizzard and how it stacked up to other historic winter storms that had impacted the Chicago area in prior decades. Chicago’s Top Four Snowstorms – Which Was the Worst? Jim Allsopp and Richard Castro, Feb 2011 
Groundhog Day Blizzard 2011: How timing, conditions led to travel nightmare. The Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2011 was seen coming several days in advance, but still nobody expected it to have quite  
Peak wind gusts during the blizzard occurred between 7 PM Tuesday, February 1st and 4 AM Wednesday, February 2nd. Sustained northeast winds of 30 to 40 mph were common through the event, with peak wind gusts between 45 and 65 mph, with the strongest gusts near Lake Michigan. 
The Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2011, which crippled Chicago for more than a day, was also nicknamed by some as “Snowpocalypse” or “Snowmageddon” because of its surreal ability to put  
Others called it the Groundhog Day Blizzard – as it came to its apex on Wednesday, Feb. 2. In a city known for some big winter storms, this was one for the ages. It dumped 21.2 inches all told  
The snow was coming down at such a furious rate that hundreds of cars were stranded -- and 25,000 calls flooded 911 lines in just 24 hours. 
A very large and strong winter storm hit the central and northeastern U.S. and southern Canada between February 1 st and 3 rd and was dubbed the 'Groundhog’s Day Blizzard of 2011'. Impacts were also felt from New Mexico northward to Wisconsin and eastward into Maine. 
On February 1 st –3 rd a large and powerful winter storm, dubbed the "Groundhog Day Blizzard", hit the central and northern regions of the United States from New Mexico northward to Wisconsin, and eastward to New England. The storm stretched for thousands of miles, leaving behind at least five inches (12.7 cm) of snow in 22 states. 
That made it the third heaviest blizzard in Chicago history, outdone only by the infamous blizzard on Jan. 26-27, 1967, when 23 inches fell, and the blizzard of Jan. 1-3, 1999, which brought 21.6  
Once snow began, visibilities dropped to around 1/4 mile in an hour or less. The rapid onset of blizzard to near blizzard conditions was likely due to the high pressure, specifically its location. Typically, the cold, dry, Arctic air masses are located north or northeast of our forecast area. 
Groundhog Day Blizzard, 2011. During the overnight hours of Feb 1 to Feb 2, a powerful low pressure center passing south of Wisconsin produced blizzard conditions across much of southern Wisconsin. Snow associated with the system began in the mid-afternoon hours in far southern Wisconsin and pushed northward into the state through the evening. 
The Groundhog Day Blizzard, as it was officially named, was immortalized with eerie overhead photographs of hundreds of abandoned vehicles, including mighty CTA articulated buses, helplessly  
We looked to the future (sort of) and went back to the Groundhog Day blizzard of 2011. This storm lasted from January 31st to February 3rd and impacted a large part of the United States. The  
Northern Illinois and northwest Indiana were walloped by one of the most powerful winter storms in history between Jan. 31 and Feb. 2, 2011. An initial period of light accumulating snow occurred  
The last time the snowpack was this deep was 10 years ago during the Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2011.Subscribe to WISN on YouTube now for more:  
The Groundhog Day Blizzard produced 17.7″ of snow in 2 days. Grand Rapids had 6.1″ on Feb. 1 and another 11.1″ on Feb. 2. It was cold enough (warmest temp. during the snowfall was 24°) that
