        <h2><strong>groundhog day reddit psychology of groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Groundhog Day killed Murray and Ramis' friendship and work relationship. A grudge Murray held until Ramis was practically on his death bed. Murray saw it as a philosophical, existential metaphor for humanity while Ramis wanted it to be a straightforward comedy and trying to get every possible laugh he could out of the story. 
Groundhog Day(1993) Discussion Just gave this a rewatch. 30yrs old now and this movie is amazing.  A sub reddit dedicated to everything about '90s. Members Online  
But long before the days of Reddit, "Groundhog Day" has been a touchstone for religious analysis. Various groups have given their interpretations of Phil Connors' story. 
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate  
If you’re looking for something a little different to break the monotony of the winter season, here are some fun and unique ways to celebrate Groundhog Day. 1. Watch Groundhog Day—and Live It Like Bill Murray! Let’s be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray’s comedic  
It's clearly established that Phil's day restarts at 6:00 AM. He wakes up in the bed and breakfast to Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe," and the day begins the same way every single time (the weather discussion with the proprietor, meeting Ned, etc.). 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
Get ready to laugh out loud with the top 75 Groundhog Day jokes! From witty one-liners to clever wordplay, this list has it all. Start your festivities off right with some much-needed giggles. 
Groundhog Day film 1993 reddit Just a sub for fans, and for any and all things related to the 1993 Harold Ramis "Groundhog Day" film, starring Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot, Stephen Tobolowsky--and Scooter the Groundhog. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
"Groundhog Day" is basically a movie about a self-obsessed stalker taking 200 days to figure out what the woman he's after actually likes and using that info to get her. Until it's not. Because Phil does get his girl, but that isn't good enough, so the day keeps resetting. 
Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time. 
I know I'm years late on this (ironically for Groundhog Day), but just was re-watching.. Yes, the line was cheesy and blatantly silly - but, I think the bartender *is* in on it and is much more important to the story than just a guy pouring drinks. 
So, if you are living in fear in a Groundhog Day type scenario then you can guarantee the next day will start over. This is just a theory of mine. I honestly believe Groundhog Day is a grossly underrated movie. Another movie that kind of follows this theme is Stranger than Fiction with Will Ferrell. Love that movie too.

The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
Reddit's largest community for discussing musical theater, its history, and how we can all participate in and nurture this artform.  Groundhog Day was the first  
Hahah, but I think if you really think about it, you could always push your boundaries. Just making up the plan can be exciting sometimes. The first day(s) you find a suitable victim. You start thinking, sex, race, age, weight and strength. A young girl would be easy to carry
