Dive back into the beloved world of 'Groundhog Day' with Bill Murray in the extended Jeep 2020 Super Bowl commercial, a nostalgic and hilarious revisit to on 
Jeep's Extended Bill Murray 'Groundhog Day' Super Bowl Ad And Behind The Scenes Footage From The Production Of The Commercial.Bill Murray agreed to reprise t 
The commercial was filmed over three days in Woodstock, Illinois, and only finished up on Jan. 26. The town was also the same location where the original movie was shot. But it also almost didn‚Äôt happen. Francois realized last fall that the Super Bowl and Groundhog Day would be occurring on the same day for only the second time in 54 years. 
This was as much an homage to "Groundhog Day," 28 years later, as it was a commercial for Jeep. It was as much a tribute to the movie's fans as it was a pitch to buy a pickup truck. 
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù all over again as Jeep brand debuts a Big Game spot starring Bill Murray (in his first-ever national television commercial). But this time reliving the same day over and over again is always a new adventure when you‚Äôre driving the 2020 Jeep Gladiator. 
Persuading Murray to reprise his role came down to a chance meeting, a lengthy letter and surprise call two weeks before the game. 
#1 USA Today Ad Meter 2020 - Bill Murray wakes up to find himself back in Groundhog Day, 27 years later. Except this time, things are different. True, he is reliving

In Jeep's Super Bowl commercial: Bill Murray and other original Groundhog's Day cast members reenact scenes from the movie, only the Bill's character now uses a Jeep to go on outings with the ground hog. 
This Sunday isn't only the Super Bowl, it's Groundhog Day, and what better way to celebrate both than with a big game commercial that includes Bill Murray.. That's exactly the route Jeep decided

Jeep: Groundhog Day: Directed by Jim Jenkins. With Justin Campbell, Brian Doyle-Murray, Kevin Lingle, Bill Murray. In Jeep's Super Bowl commercial: Bill Murray and other original Groundhog's Day cast members reenact scenes from the movie, only the Bill's character now uses a Jeep to go on outings with the ground hog. 
Air Date: 2/2/2020This ad was one of five nominated for a 2020 Emmy for Outstanding Commercial. See who would win if the voting were up to the general public 
Which is why Bill Murray‚Äîplaying Phil Connors from the 1993 movie Groundhog Day‚Äîis back again in a commercial that reuses footage from the brand's Super Bowl Jeep Gladiator commercial that  
And lucky enough for Jeep, a cherry on top: Murray confirmed himself via news release it will be his first and last commercial he‚Äôll ever star in. An all-around winning day for the brand at that Super Bowl. Have another look at the extended version of Jeep‚Äôs winning commercial below: 
For Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief marketing officer Olivier Fran√ßois, that posed a challenge when he was hit with the idea for a commercial mirroring Murray‚Äôs 1993 film, Groundhog Day, since

The Jeep¬Æ brand‚Äôs 2020 Super Bowl commercial ‚ÄúGroundhog Day,‚Äù starring Bill Murray and featuring the 2020 Jeep Gladiator, has racked up 104,246,754 views (as of 9 a.m. ET, Feb. 10) across the brand‚Äôs YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram channels. The video placed as the #1 auto ad on YouTube AdBlitz. 
Using the timely occurrence as inspiration, Jeep worked hard for Murray to appear in his first national commercial. The idea? reprising his role as Phil Connors from the 1993 film ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚Äù Murray did it, perhaps reluctantly, because he said it was his first and final appearance in a national commercial.
