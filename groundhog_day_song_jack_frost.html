Felt, but never seen, a lonely Jack begs to become human  
Jack is sent to January Junction in the human guise of Jack Snip, a tailor. Largely unrelated to the prior Rankin-Bass version of Jack Frost, who was the Paul Frees-voiced villain in 1976's 2D animated Frosty's Winter Wonderland and returned in Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July, released just a few months prior to the Jack Frost special.
