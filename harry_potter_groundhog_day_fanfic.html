This "List" consists of Harry Potter or Naruto Stories based on the idea of GroundHog's Day. Infinitly looping day, week, month or year etc. 
Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter (8) Sherlock Holmes/John Watson (8) Sirius Black/Remus Lupin (6) Exclude Additional Tags Groundhog Day (1243) Time Loop (599) Angst (254) Temporary Character Death (190) Time Travel (158) Angst with a Happy Ending (158) Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence (156) Hurt/Comfort (98) Alternate Universe (97) Fluff (92) 
The beginning of Harry's day was routine, meet Luna, get breakfast, scare the hell out of Ron and Hermione with his odd behavior. After that, Harry broke routine by going to class. "Today," Snape loomed over the first row. "I am going to attempt to drill into your thick skulls . . ." "Shut up you dirty bag of dragon droppings," Harry called out. 
Groundhog Day Albus Dumbledore leaned over his cauldron and stirred it carefully. The potion inside the cauldron was immensely complicated; it took over twenty years to complete the potion, and a single mistake made over the course of the two decades would render it completely useless. 
He watched Potter and Weasley walk down the steps with their dates. Weasley went into the hall and left Potter with his date outside. Granger arrived at the top of the steps, at first she glanced around timidly before appearing fully. Draco watched her face as she started descending the stairs, she caught Potterâ€™s eye and gave a small timid  
Also, there's Wastelands of Time, plus HP &amp; the Temporal Beacon, both of which involve a "groundhog day" like time loop. The former is Harry/Fleur and complete, the latter is H/Hr and abandoned, IIRC. Sorry I have no links, I'm on mobile atm. 
Groundhog Day â€“ Time Loop. Draco woke at 6:30 am, it was an ordinary day. Thursday the 2nd February, he didn't know that this day would be vastly different to any other day he had at this damn school. He had returned to Hogwarts to repeat his seventh year. He had never had such a boring year at Hogwarts before. 
Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged â€˜You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.â€™Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU Site : Archive of Our Own | Fandom : Harry Potter - J.

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, this is just for entertainment purposes. Besides I would not be able to make money off this as I am not that good of a writer. So for gods sake do sue. "Groundhog Day at Hogwarts" February 2 
Harry finds himself repeating the Day of the Yule Ball over and over, and he's the only one that remembers it. This may take a while to figure out, so he might as well enjoy the Ball, right?

Note that in the 1993 film Groundhog Day there is a period where the protagonist basically goes crazy after going through the same day time after time after time. This piece is a one-shot. Warning: This piece is identified as 'horror' and is rated 'M'. 
Harry Potter repeats the same day, over and over and over again, only stories with over 50k words allowed. Complete stories preferred. 
Not really a Groundhog Day story. To me, it is yet another DLP-bait, Harry-Potter-is-Wolverine fic. He drinks, he smokes, he fucks, he takes massive damage but gets better. The usual. It doesn't read like a Harry Potter story, more like the massive genre crossover it all but admits to in the author's initial blurb chapter. 
She had her eyes on him since first year, much as Draco had. But Draco was realistic and knew that he would be lucky to meet a man, as half as decent, as Potter. Potter was straight, Potter was the saviour, Potter was the exact opposite to Draco in every way. Opposing houses, opposing sides in the war, and even opposing sexuality. 
Harry Potter Slash FanFiction. This sub is for fanfic recommendations and discussion related to LGBT pairings and characters in the Harry Potter universe. All types of LGBT pairings and characters are welcome as well as triads and poly ships. 
Yet, Potter wouldn't remember all the hard work and effort Draco had put in. Today he had enough, he waited until Potter once again escaped the common room to hide from Weaslette. Potter was sat in a huge window seat, looking out the window at the sky. Draco stopped in front of him and coughed to make Harry aware that he was there. 
In early 1993, the Bill Murray masterpiece Groundhog Day came out- the story of a man forced to relive the same day over and over again until he got things right. Unfortunately, for Harry, getting things right was easier said than done. 
Groundhog Day. Daphne was startled awake the next morning by a couple of friends bouncing on her bed. 'What the hell are you doing?' Daphne said to her two friends who had settled cross-legged on the end of her bed, beaming smiles on their faces. 'Good morning to you too, Miss Lucky,' Tracey said. 'Tell us everything,' Millicent said. Daphne  </p>
