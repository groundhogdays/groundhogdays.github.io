        <h2><strong>groundhog day christian review when is groundhog day 2025 video</strong></h2>
        <p>“G roundhog Day” is a light-hearted comedy that is enjoyable and well done. I have seen it several times and have liked it each time. “Groundhog Day” stars Bill Muray as an egotistical TV weather man who has been sent to Punxsutawney, PA to cover Groundhog Day (February 2nd). He is rude to everyone he meets and has no human charity  
National Review scribe Jonah Goldberg, for one, noted the film’s expansive resonance with the Catholic concept of purgatory, the Hindu and Buddhist takes on reincarnation, and the Jewish understanding of mitzvahs, or good works. I’d suggest Groundhog Day can also be read as a fable of Christian sanctification. 
But this is why Groundhog Day is ultimately not a ‘Christian’ movie. Phil was trapped reliving Groundhog’s Day for eight years, eight months, and 16 days before he learned he was stuck with virtue. But he’ll spend the rest of eternity realizing that’s not enough to save him. 
As discussed in National Review’s 2005 piece on the film (that’s been run as a headline every year on Groundhog Day since), the movie’s reinvigoration can be attested to the film’s overt religiosity. It’s been embraced by every major religious group including Christians of all stripes, Jewish groups, Hindus, Buddhists, Wiccans  
Groundhog day with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is on many peoples Top 10 favorite movies of all time. But who knew that the movie has deep philosophical and Christian themes – in fact, it is a very Catholic. The Theology of Groundhog Day The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil–a weatherman who finds himself re-living a single day of his life–Groundhog Day. If you haven’t seen the movie  
In Groundhog Day, time seems literally endless. But for us, on this Earth, time is a finite thing—and often, the time given to us feels oh so short. Because of Groundhog Day’s time loop, Phil Connors has the opportunity to live the day again and again—correcting mistakes, perfecting approaches, honing himself into, well, a decent human  
Jonah Goldberg, editor-at-large of National Review Online. Groundhog Day is “a stunning allegory of moral, intellectual, and even religious excellence in the face of postmodern decay, a sort of Christian-Aristotelian Pilgrim’s Progress for those lost in the contemporary cosmos.”—Michael Foley, professor of theology at Notre Dame 
In a wonderful essay for the Christian magazine Touchstone, theology professor Michael P. Foley wrote that Groundhog Day is “a stunning allegory of moral, intellectual, and even religious  
The Theology of Groundhog Day. The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil--a weatherman who finds himself re-living a single day of his life--Groundhog Day. If you haven't seen the movie, you can check out the trailer above. The movie beautifully illustrates the way Bill Murray discovers true happiness in the pursuit of Aristotle's virtuous "good life". 
Groundhog Day runs 103 minutes and is rated PG. For our review of the film and a plot synopsis, click here. 1. THE TASKS YOU ARE HERE TO WORK ON. Ralph Waldo Emerson has written, "The authorities of the universe put you here with some tasks strictly appointed you in your constitution, and so long as you work at that, you are well and successful."

Slowly a popular winter festival evolved, but one largely shorn of its Christian roots. Today Groundhog Day takes its place as a growing phenomenon in the United States complete with school observances, greeting cards, trinkets and paraphernalia for purchase, and even a federally-sanctioned "official" groundhog in Pennsylvania. 
VIOLENCE/GORE 3 - A man tries to kill himself, unsuccessfully on several occasions: He drives a stolen truck, slams into a fence and speeds over a ravine crashing into a quarry and we see the truck fall and explode when it hits the ground below (we see the man unharmed later), he then drops a toaster into a bathtub filled with water to electrocute himself (we see him unharmed later), he steps  
Groundhog Day is this weekend so let's review how accurate the groundhog is!  Groundhog Day has both Pagan and Christian roots all the way back to the 18 th and 19 th centuries, and even  
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
Yes, Groundhog Day really does have a Christian connection! Today, February 2, is not only Groundhog Day, but also the 40th day after Christmas, which is the day that Mary and Joseph presented Jesus at the Temple, in keeping with the teaching in Leviticus. We learn about this in Luke’s Gospel: 
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. More Videos. Next up in 5.

Groundhog Day (1993) - Movies, TV, Celebs, and more The funniest moments in Groundhog Day come when Phil takes sneaky advantage of his predicament-by, say, pumping a sexy woman in the local coffee shop for facts about her past and then, ''the next day,'' using the information to lure her into bed. </p>
