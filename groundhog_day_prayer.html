        <h2><strong>groundhog day prayer how long was phil connors in groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>This Groundhog Day Prayer is a good way to connect the traditional celebration of Groundhog Day with our desire for better, warmer days to come quickly and for winter to end soon. Although Groundhog Day is not a religious celebration, it grew out of a day on the church calendar called Candlemas.

About this Candlemas Prayer for the Light of the World. I had never heard of Candlemas until I decided to look up the origin of Groundhog Day which is celebrated in the US on February 2 each year. As you probably know, tradition has it that on Groundhog Day if the animal sees his shadow, there will be 6 more weeks of winter. 
February 2, 2021 If you watched Bill Murray in the movie Groundhog Day in 1993 (can it really be that long ago?), then you know the premise—Murray's character, Phil, awakens to the same day again and again and again. That is how my prayer life--not to mention my actual life--has felt during these long months 
That's a real cause for celebration on this Groundhog Day, and always. From a devotion originally written for "By the Way" THE PRAYER: Dear Lord Jesus, through every day, through every season, You are with us. We celebrate in this--that You loved us enough to lay down Your life for us and make every day new. Blessed be Your Name. Amen. 
After all, even the timid groundhog eventually raises his head, takes a whiff of clover and scurries from his hole. Dear Lord, this Groundhog Day, give me the courage to confront my shadows. Share this story 
A 1993 movie expanded on this “repeatability” nature of Groundhog Day. The movie, titled Groundhog Day, focused on a weatherman who was given the same assignment every year. For the fourth year in a row, he was sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day events. Begrudgingly, he went and gave his report. However  
An article for The Cathedral Times by the Very Rev. Sam Candler, Dean of the Cathedral February 2, 2025. Let me tell you another story. (And please read until the end!) The earliest United States observance of something called Groundhog Day dates back to the nineteenth century, maybe in the decades before the founding of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, in 1899. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Because Jesus is the Light of the World Who, with His coming to earth, dispelled the darkness of sin, the Church blesses candles on this day for use in the liturgy and for home prayer. A candlelit procession is often included in the liturgy, recalling the entrance of this Light into His Temple. + 
Every year, without fail, I watch “Groundhog Day” — the perfect, masterful Bill Murray flick — on Groundhog Day. Yesterday, I didn’t. I failed. It’s not like you can’t watch the movie on a different day other than the official, Punxsutawney-endorsed day. But it’s not the same. 
When the kids have their groundhog masks made, have them put them on and complete an obstacle course while wearing the masks. Say: Today is Groundhog’s Day. That means that very early this morning, a groundhog had to make his way out of his home and into the cold to “predict” how long it will be until winter ends. 
It is also Candlemas. Forty days after the birth of Jesus, Mary and Joseph take the infant to the Temple for blessing, as was Jewish custom. Celebrated since the 4th century as the Presentation of Jesus, it marks the time when old Simeon and Anna recognize something in the Child and announce him as “the Light.”

Groundhog Day is a funny holiday, isn’t it? All across the country people watch a cute little groundhog come out of his hole just to find out if he can see his shadow. The tradition says if he sees his shadow, we’ll have six more weeks of winter weather, but if he doesn’t see it, we can expect an early spring. 
Feb. 2 is the Presentation of the Lord, a feast day that celebrates the day Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem. That day is also Groundhog Day. Zach Jansen, the digital content producer for the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul, joined the “Practicing Catholic” program set to air at 9 p.m. Jan. 31 on Relevant Radio 1330 AM, to share themes of faith and

Groundhog Day (1993) clip with quote I like to say a prayer and drink to world peace. Yarn is the best search for video clips by quote. Find the exact moment in a TV show, movie, or music video you want to share. Easily move forward or backward to get to the perfect clip. 
Seeing a groundhog might seem mundane, but for me it was an answered prayer. God heard when I asked to see the groundhog and somehow inspired him to pay me a visit. On that warm summer day, God used nature to declare His love, affection, and attention toward me. 
Last Sunday, an article was published in the Dallas Morning News that every evangelical should read. In The Daily Article for February 2, 2021, Dr. Jim Denison tells this story, then focuses on two reasons Christian nationalism is so tempting and closes with our best way to love and serve America. </p>
