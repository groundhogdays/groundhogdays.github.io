        <h2><strong>why was bill murray stuck in groundhog day groundhog day meaning oxford</strong></h2>
        <p>Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Not only is 1993's Groundhog Day considered one of Bill Murray's best films ever, but it's also widely regarded as one of the finest comedies to come out of the 1990s. It's the perfect blend of  
While many people have done the math on how long Bill Murray's character was trapped in the same day - various estimates range from about 500 years up to 10,000 years - the exact reason as to why  
Widely considered to be one of the best comedy movies of all time, "Groundhog Day's" story of weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) struggling to break free from living the same 24-hour period  
Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, forced to relive the titular annual holiday forever. After Phil finds his purpose in life and becomes a better person, the curse is broken and Phil is finally freed from the time loop. 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned  It stars Bill Murray as Pittsburgh weather reporter  Phil's initial shock at being stuck in his worst waking nightmare  
Either way, today is Groundhog Day and in the 1993 film of the same name, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to live the same day over and over again, improving himself a little bit each and  
What's not to love about Bill Murray as an ill-fated weatherman who is forced to relive the same day over and over in Groundhog Day? Comedy gold. If you've ever wondered the real reasons why Murray's sourpuss meteorologist was chosen to repeat the same sadistic time loop, voiceover artist Eddie Deezen has your answer. 
Last Groundhog Day, February 2nd, one cable channel played Groundhog Day over and over, for the entire day. Nice gag. Nice gag. Groundhog Day also makes for great discussions, and numerous theories about the movie and its meaning have been put forth. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
In "Groundhog Day," playing a formerly smug weatherman who finds himself condemned to relive one Feb. 2 over and over again in Punxsutawney, Pa., Bill Murray explains his feelings to two bleary  
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  
And then Bill Murray, I think, got very involved. Bill Murray was involved in a divorce at the time and apparently was very difficult to work with, not unlike as we shall see the character that he plays [laughs]. Originally the film was sort of just a, you know, it would’ve been “light comedy”, I think that was forgotten. 
In one of his finest roles, Bill Murray plays sarcastic and arrogant Pittsburgh weather forecaster Phil Connors in Harold Ramis' 1993 masterpiece, Groundhog Day. Phil believes that he's destined  </p>
