        <p>I Got You Babe - Sonny &amp; Cher("Groundhog Day" - "Ricomincio Da Capo", 1993)YOU CAN BUY THE SOUNDTRACK HERE:  CAN BUY THE MOVIE HERE 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere. 
The movie grew a cult of fans that watched it every February 2, giving it a foothold in the popular culture. By association, "I Got You Babe" became part of the groundhog day tradition. In 2020, Bill Murray appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for the Jeep Gladiator where the song plays throughout. In the spot, he re-creates the film, but this  
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day.

In Groundhog Day, "I Got You Babe" serves as Phil Connors' radio alarm in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania's Cherry Tree Inn, with each repetition of his time loop opening around the song's halfway point and transitioning into banter by the radio hosts. The song seems endearing and naïve upon its initial use, but with each loop Phil's reaction  
Bill Murray can't stop waking up to the Sonny and Cher song "I Got You Babe" in the movie Groundhog Day. Playing the surly weatherman Phil Connors, Murray heads to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, for a familiar ritual: the emergence of Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog that will determine whether or not we'll have six more weeks of winter  
The song that greets Bill Murray every morning, “I’ve Got You Babe” by Sonny and Cher, was in Danny Rubin’s original script from the beginning. What song does Phil play in Groundhog Day? The overall fun song that is playing every morning when Phil Connors (Bill Murray) wakes up at the bed and breakfast in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania in  
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there. 
It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach?

"It's Gonna Rain" never made Billboard's Hot Top 100 chart; but on the day the movie open the duo's "I Got You Babe" was in its third and final week at #1 on the Top 100 chart * The movie was directed by Maury Dexter, and between 1979 and 1983 he directed 21 episodes of the NBC-TV weekly-family series 'Little House on the Prairie'. 
Sonny &amp; Cher proved one of the magical musical combinations of the mid '60s and one of the better rock-influenced MOR acts of the early '70s, their wisecrack
