        <p>Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
Broadway Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ The Musical.  Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are  
Review. Groundhog Day the Musical. 5 out of 5 stars. Despite being based on repetition, this musical masterpiece manages to be constantly surprising  Overall, Groundhog Day is a movie to  
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
'Groundhog Day: The Musical' Review: A Splendid, High-Spirited Retelling Of A Classic By Jack Giroux Aug. 24, 2017 11:30 am EST The Groundhog Day musical is a joyful experience about one huge jerk. 
If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." 
It’s Phil’s journey more than his destination that makes “Groundhog Day” such joy, as Mr. Karl — previously seen as the punch-drunk title contendah of the “Rocky” musical — gives  
Content warning: this review contains references to self-harm and suicide. Phil Connors, the protagonist of Groundhog Day – both in the original 1993 film and in the musical theatre version – is condemned to live the same day over and over again until he learns some fundamental truths about himself, and figures out how he can become a better human being. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day, the Olivier Award-winning new musical featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchinand a book by Danny Rubin, and directed by Matthew Warchus, opens tonight, Monday April 17, on  
Groundhog Day, a new musical about a man who must experience the same day over and over until he gets it right, opens August 16 at London's Old Vic Theatre. Based on the popular 1993 film comedy  
Seven years after its premiere, the Groundhog Day musical is back at the Old Vic. Andy Karl is still playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors, condemned to relive a single day over and over. And I still love it. 
Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl. 
Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin.  Due to huge public demand and rave reviews, the production extended by  
Groundhog Day on Broadway has received nominations for SEVEN Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Original Score and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical for Andy Karl; FIVE Outer Critics Circle Award nominations; TWO Drama League Award nominations and a Drama Desk Award nomination. 
Reuniting the Tony Award-winning team behind “Matilda,” “Groundhog Day” cracks open Danny Rubin’s story for the  London Theater Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ the Musical Old Vic  
Groundhog Day was the first musical theatre sheet music book I bought - I figured "If I can play this, I can play anything".  Here we have discussions and reviews  
The musical Groundhog Day is far more reflective of Minchin’s comedy than anyone else’s, it even manages to work in a musical dig at alternative therapies almost apropos of nothing, to really  
If this production doesn’t end up with a long run in the West End (and it should), it would make a great alternative to the Old Vic’s annual Groundhog Day-like repeat of A Christmas Carol. Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket. </p>
