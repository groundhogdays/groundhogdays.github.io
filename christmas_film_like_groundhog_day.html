        <p>Why you'll like this movie: Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly.

Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
The classic 1993 movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a surly weatherman sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the tiny town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil (who openly

Bill Murray repeating the same day over and over is certainly unique, but here are 12 movies like "Groundhog Day" we think you should check out. 
Some dabble with the idea of goodwill toward men, others not at all, but every year you’ll likely see at least a few in the post-Christmas day TV listings. Santa won’t be climbing down any chimneys here (well, not without swearing). 1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. 
Harold Ramis’ 1993 classic Groundhog Day is simply one of the most perfect movies ever made; Bill Murray’s snarky sense-of-humor has never been more endearing, and Ramis’ script is both  
Christmas Every Day: 1996: An American television movie based on William Dean Howells's 1892 short story "Christmas Every Day". A selfish teenager is forced to relive the same Christmas every day.

I do, I do, I do (2015) - this was the one I watched years ago, it felt different now to watch it understand my current situation. It's an okay movie, like any standard Hallmark movie.

The 6 stars are barely achieved in this christmas film in which the theme of groundhog day is copied very literally, actually that theme is in itself quite ideal for a nice christmas story, but then it has to be executed well and the main character has to make logical decisions with good edits to make the story run smoothly. 
Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. 
"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:
