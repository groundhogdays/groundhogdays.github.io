        <h2><strong>eminem groundhog day reddit how many days in groundhog day reddit</strong></h2>
        <p>That song is so boring. Like yeah the way he rhymed on it was cool but there wasn't any energy, it was just monotone until the end of the last verse and groundhog day is a better song than legacy, first he tells the story better and em finally did a song with no hook or features, which is what I've been asking for a couple of years 
this song isn't a repost and isn't on the favorites list.. A lot of Eminem songs are though because he's considered to be one of the greatest artists of all time, so many of his albums are on the favorites list (SSLP, MMLP, TES, Relapse) and people frequently post his songs. 
Welcome everybody to the very first SotW of February. The last time that we listened to this week's track was actually back in July of 2021. We're going back to the Deluxe edition of 'The Marshall Mathers LP2' again for the next seven days, as 'Groundhog Day' has been selected by u/hollivore as this week's featured track. 
This is one of Eminem's most underrated songs ever. MMLP2 is underrated, in general. Hot take: this should've been Eminem's last album. He would've gone out on a high-note. Revival, Kamikaze and all of the freestyles he's put out since have hurt his legacy quite a bit. 
I highly recommend MMLP2 Deluxe Edition tracks. Baby is awesome, his flow is top notch here. Desperation is good. Then Beautiful Pain, Groundhog Day, Wicked Ways are excellent. Don't sleep on "Don't Front" too.

Eminem’s lyrics punish the opponents like a father does to a son. He is putting his opponents hide in the sun to turn it into leather. A “bicycle built for a two” is known as a tandem.

This song about Eminem’s childhood in Detroit, Michigan is based on the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. In the movie, the same day repeats itself over and over again, and “tomorrow 
In this really aggressive and engaging song, Eminem tells his story (once again), but this time with a nice original spin on it. He compares his life to the movie "Groundhog Day", where the main character gets stuck in a time loop. He's forced to live out a day over and over and over again. Eminem compares this to his life as a child.

Welcome everybody to the second SotW of July. The last time that we listened to this week's track was actually back in December of 2018.

Groundhog Day is a movie about a guy reliving the same day over and over. Just like that day that never changes, Eminem is saying he's never gonna change his ways. Plus there's also the point of him going through the same bullshit as a kid, as u/CharmanderIsGod said. </p>
