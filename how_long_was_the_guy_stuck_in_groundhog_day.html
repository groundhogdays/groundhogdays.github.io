        <h2><strong>how long was the guy stuck in groundhog day groundhog day birthday memes</strong></h2>
        <p>According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
Fans of the seasonal comedy classic "Groundhog Day" have wondered for decades how long Phil Conners spent reliving the same day — and there’s still no definitive answer. Columbia Pictures The film’s original commentary claimed Phil Connors was stuck for 10 years. 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
Widely considered to be one of the best comedy movies of all time, "Groundhog Day's" story of weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) struggling to break free from living the same 24-hour period  
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures According to Whatculture.com , Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
From that perspective, Groundhog Day shows us a glimpse of a man’s life during those 10,000 years. The revelation of the length of time Phil was “stuck”, comes from Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned, during a recent interview with Chris Hardwick on the Nerdist podcast. 
GROUNDHOG DAY saw Bill Murray’s Phil Connors trapped in a time loop, but how long for? By George Simpson , Senior Film and Arts Reporter 13:31, Fri, Feb 2, 2018 | UPDATED: 13:38, Fri, Feb 2, 2018 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
"According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. 
2 February is Groundhog Day – when, according to Punxsutawney folklore, a groundhog called Punxsutawney Phil predicts the arrival of spring. The tradition spawned the 1993 comedy classic that saw Bill Murray's sardonic TV weatherman Phil Connors stuck in the same day over and over again. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
I may have seen the movie 20-odd times and still wouldn't know the answer to your question. Time and time again I marvel at what may be the reason the loop ends and find different answers each time. 
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395
