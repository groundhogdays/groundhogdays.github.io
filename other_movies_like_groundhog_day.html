Groundhog Day is easily my favorite movie, and my other favorite movies have a very similar feel. Hook with Robin Williams, and Yes Man with Jim Carrey are really good. It also helps when a funny person is the lead like Bill Murray. 
I have always loved Groundhog Day and those kind of looped-day movies. They seem to be picking up in popularity too now, even Netflix has one slated as Russian Doll. Aside from that one I can think of ARQ, Before I Fall, Happy Death Day and Edge of Tomorrow - what other movies like this can you suggest? 
I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right. On top of my head I can think about Back to the Future and Edge of Tomorrow. Do you know any similar movies? Thank you.

I do, I do, I do (2015) - this was the one I watched years ago, it felt different now to watch it understand my current situation. It's an okay movie, like any standard Hallmark movie. Just feel like sharing, thought someone maybe interested in the Groundhog Day theme too. And if there are other Hallmark movies similar, please let me know! 
Yes, Groundhog Day was well received when it came out - but that doesn't change the fact that the movie has grown to its current level of appreciation in the 5-20 years since its release. Reply HULKx • • Edited </p>
