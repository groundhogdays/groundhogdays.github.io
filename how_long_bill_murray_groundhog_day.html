        <h2><strong>how long bill murray groundhog day when does groundhog day start time</strong></h2>
        <p>This brings us back to the original question: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? Originally, the film's director, Harold Ramis, stated that he thought Bill's character was trapped in Punxsutawney for about 10 years. In 2009, however, he revealed that estimate was probably too short. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day." According to their findings, Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a period totaling eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
That reply of Ramis was due to an earlier analysis (linked to by DampeS8N in a comment: "How Long Does Bill Murray Spend in Groundhog Day?", Wolf Gnards) Which puts us at the grand total of 3176 repeated Groundhog days, or 453 weeks, or 105 months, or 8.7 years. Precisely, 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days. 
Working out how long Bill Murray was stuck in Groundhog Day. To figure it out the movie had to be broken down into three key stages. These stages are the 38 shown in the movie, the 414 days mentioned in the movie (which included card tricks and robbing a bank), and the mammoth 11,931 days he spent learning. 
Harold Ramis, the director and co-writer of the 1993 film, has been asked this question before, and his response has been anywhere from 10 to 40 years that Bill Murray's character spent reliving  
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ “Bill Murray was a lot of fun. He was very cordial to everybody in Punxsutawney and he was signing autographs — a very nice man. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Per IMDB, "On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years." OR "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
I may have seen the movie 20-odd times and still wouldn't know the answer to your question. Time and time again I marvel at what may be the reason the loop ends and find different answers each time. 
Which puts us at the grand total of 3176 repeated Groundhog days, or 453 weeks, or 105 months, or 8.7 years. Precisely, 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days.So, in the end Harold Ramis was right and I wasted a Bill Murray length of my time. </p>
