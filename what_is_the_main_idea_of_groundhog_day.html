        <p>Clymer Freas (1867–1942) [m] who was city editor at the Punxsutawney Spirit is credited as the "father" who conceived the idea of "Groundhog Day".

Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks.

The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd.

Groundhog Day is a tradition that takes place every year on February 2.Prompted by members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club—who dress up in top hats and tuxedos for the ceremony—Punxsutawney Phil emerges from a special burrow in Gobbler's Knob, a rural park nestled just outside of the small town of Punxsutawney.
