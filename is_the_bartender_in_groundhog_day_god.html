        <p>Agreed. I understand the idea the bartender would have to avoid Phil for all the years Phil was stuck in the loop. However, I think the bartender is a guardian angel. It is his sole duty to look over Phil. Even if it means pouring drinks for years/decades. 
Phil is a self centered jerk (to our pleasure most of the movie) but as he lives the same day over and over he eventually comes to care for the town and their people. Once he's became a better person, February 3rd finally comes. So with that said, it's not out of the realm of possibly that God is there watching. 
Throughout the film, Phil seems to be the only person in Groundhog Day who knows what he is going to. However, there is a bartender who repeatedly observes Phil, often with a smile. He does this especially when Phil is trying to win over Rita. Was it possible he was suppose to symbplize an angel of sorts? Sent down to make sure Phil would change. 
Groundhog day with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is on many peoples Top 10 favorite movies of all time. But who knew that the movie has deep philosophical and Christian themes ‚Äì in fact, it is a very Catholic. The Theology of Groundhog Day The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil‚Äìa weatherman who finds himself re-living a single day of his life‚ÄìGroundhog Day. If you haven‚Äôt seen the movie  
I‚Äôd suggest Groundhog Day can also be read as a fable of Christian sanctification. The key to unlocking that view comes in a scene set in a diner, where Phil supplies proof of his predicament and debates his possible divinity with Rita. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a god. I‚Äôm not the God, I don‚Äôt think,‚Äù he says. Walking Rita around the diner, he relays  
With the help of ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù, lots of viewers may reconsider their own lives and improve them. It is not that difficult to watch the movie, learn something from it, analyze the behavior of main ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù characters, and comprehend the essence of ethical aspects such as human duties, self-esteem, and respect to the others. 
Movie question: Groundhog Day. Printer-friendly format Email this thread to a friend Bookmark this thread: This topic is archived. Home ¬ª Discuss ¬ª The DU Lounge 
In 2003, ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù (Harold Ramis, 1993) was screened on the opening night of a Museum of Modern Art session titled ‚Äò The Hidden God: Film and Faith‚Äô. Religious groups were invited to throw light on what it meant for their individual faiths. 
He clearly looks and shakes his head as if he's seen and used to Phil Conners ploy of ordering the same drink. I believe it's the use of a common trope of an elderly bartender being stuck in some sort of perpetual eternity. I base this solely off a 1-2 second shot of the character. 
‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù stars Bill Muray as an egotistical TV weather man who has been sent to Punxsutawney, PA to cover Groundhog Day (February 2nd). He is rude to everyone he meets and has no human charity whatsoever. After the ‚Äúfirst Groundhog Day‚Äù Bill Murray goes to sleep and awakens to find that it is the same Groundhog Day all over again  
The bartender has no lines, but he repeatedly disapproves of Phil by shaking his head as Phil relives the same day. My theory is that the bartender is an immortal who controls the time loop and traps Phil until he becomes a better person. 
Groundhog Day - Phil's a God: Phil (Bill Murray) tries to explain to a skeptical Rita (Andie MacDowell) that he is a God.BUY THE MOVIE:  
Phil had to overcome the seven deadly sins in order to escape the time loop.Almost all of the seven deadly sins make an appearance in the movie. Think about it: Sloth: Sitting around in a bathrobe watching game shows till he has them memorized. 
Phil (Bill Murray) describes his struggle of reliving a single day to the localsDirector: Harold RamisIn this scene: Bill Murray, Rick Overton, Rick Ducommun 
Phil is stuck in his loop, and finally released from it, by the bartender. As to why he does it, I don't know. Maybe he's a trickster, a Puka like Harvey perhaps. The bartender silently watches Phil. The first night there, Phil is a jerk. He is rude to the bartender. Watch the bartenders eyes, his reaction. 
Here‚Äôs what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It‚Äôs a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again.
