Bill nicely invited me to hang around and watch them filming (which I probably could of done anyway, but nice of him). I watched them film quite a few scenes, including seeing him do the stepping in the puddle bit about a million times. Until the court stuff was over, I continued to hang around the set each day and watch them film.
