I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right. 
Interesting surrealist horror movie! Twisted Groundhog Day! Very interesting dark imagery that you will see again and again. Never realized how unnerving mosquitoes sound. Now sure if I enjoyed but I’ll probably never watch it again. I feel it does have artistic merit! You can check it out on Shudder. 
Small things like lighting, music, camera angles, the look on an actor's face etc can make a massive difference as to whether a movie comes across as a horror or a comedy. Given that Groundhog Day was made by some of the finest comic veterans in the industry, I think it's a fair bet to say that it was never meant to be a horror movie. </p>
