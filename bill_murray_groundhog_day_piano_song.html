Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film which follows the eccentric weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray.

What is the song that Bill Murray wakes up to each morning? (from Tim Rogers in Dallas TX) A: Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe." (thanks to Pucksy, PA) add more info: Q: During the scene in the middle of the film where Phil decides to start learning piano there is a classical piece playing in the background.

William Cramer on 22nd of February 2020. Awesome. So glad you did this. When I was young, I wanted to learn and actually did play the piano because of this movie. Instead of doing nothing everyday in my life, watching VHS tapes and playing Nintendo back then, I thought Bill Murray was right.
