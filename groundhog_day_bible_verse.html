        <p>Beforehand, print off the Groundhog Bible Verse Cards found below and hide them around the room. Say: Today, we have six Groundhogs with us. They are all hidden around the room, just waiting for the opportunity to come out of their hiding places and share some news with us! 
Here are some scriptures that would work for Groundhog Day that talk about shadowy times, God’s light, and needing patience to receive God’s blessings: ISAIAH”© 9:2: THE “©PEOPLE”© WALKING “©IN “©DARKNESS”© HAVE “©SEEN “©A “©GREAT “©LIGHT; “©ON “©THOSE”© LIVING “©IN “©THE “©LAND”© OF  
You think it’s Groundhog Day? Then let me tell you, it’s been Groundhog Day since 900 BC. Our lives felt pretty stable until a tiny virus disrupted the world. It toppled our carefully constructed lives and skewed every detail. We feel helpless and vulnerable. We’re not in control like we thought. It was an illusion. People are dying. 
A 1993 movie expanded on this “repeatability” nature of Groundhog Day. The movie, titled Groundhog Day, focused on a weatherman who was given the same assignment every year. For the fourth year in a row, he was sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day events. Begrudgingly, he went and gave his report. However  
It is widely recognized for its ability to predict the arrival of spring based on its behavior on Groundhog Day, celebrated every February 2nd in the United States and Canada. But what does the Bible say about the groundhog and its significance? Groundhog Day: A Secular Tradition 
tradition called “Groundhog Day.” On that day, people bring out a groundhog to “guess” the weather. A groundhog is an animal that lives underground, and looks kind of like a beaver (hold up puppet or stuffed animal, if applicable). So on groundhog day, this critter comes out. People say that if it stays above 
When he wakes up the next morning, though, he finds he’s reliving the previous day—Groundhog’s Day. No one else seems to notice, so he assumes he’s merely having a bad dream. But when he wakes up again, he’s stuck living the same February 2. Phil’s trapped in a time loop from which he can’t escape. 
Happy Groundhog day! If you aren’t familiar with it, Groundhog Day is a “holiday” where we watch to see if a groundhog sees his shadow when he emerges from his burrow. If he sees it, folklore has it that we will have to endure winter for 6 more weeks! If the little guy doesn’t notice his shadow, then we can expect an early spring.

Fear not; I will help thee. Isaiah 41:13. Sunlight glistens on his whiskers as Mr. Groundhog cautiously pokes his head above his earthy burrow. He eases to his haunches, twitches his fuzzy ears and listens for signs of danger. 
Punxsutawney Phil is not the only weather predicting groundhog in America, just the most famous, thanks to Clymer Freas, who was the editor of the Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper in 1886. On February 2, 1886, Freas issued the following proclamation: “Today is groundhog day and up to the time of going to press the beast has not seen its shadow.” 
It’s Groundhog Day: Bible verse references: Romans 8:15-17, Leviticus 20:24, Exodus 5:22, Exodus 6:1, Exodus 12:31-32, Exodus 15:22-26, Exodus 16:3 To listen online simply click on the right arrow above. 
Groundhog Day – Change Happens, or Does It? February 2, 2024  Jonah’s 8 verse prayer in Chapter 2 is a prototype prayer for every lost soul. 
Phil has become a celebrity and has appeared on various television shows, on a jumbo screen in Times Square and as the star of the 1993 movie “Groundhog Day.” (Although the real Phil was not allowed in the movie because it was filmed in Illinois instead of Pennsylvania, and the Groundhog Day organizers were notably upset.) 
“Groundhog Day has its roots in the ancient Christian tradition of Candlemas Day, when clergy would bless and distribute candles needed for winter. The candles represented how long and cold the winter would be. Germans expanded on this concept by selecting an animal–the hedgehog–as a means of predicting weather. 
Today the largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where as many as 40,000 people gather to see the groundhog. Subscribe Now - Catholic Online YouTube 'Help Give every Student and Teacher FREE resources for a world-class Moral Catholic Education'
