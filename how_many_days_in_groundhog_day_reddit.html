        <p>Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
How did they work it out? Well, there are 38 days actually shown on screen, as well as 414 days mentioned in the film and a huge 11,931 days which Phil spends learning a host of new talents and interests - based on the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in any given subject. 
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Watched this for the first time. (Though it was sad since Murray and Ramis’ friendship fell apart during the making of this movie) But I wonder how long he 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. 
I think Phil would've gone utterly insane in 10,000 years living the same day. Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day".

Per IMDB, "On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years." OR "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
there are some holes in this analysis. one is that he mastered each thing presented under the 10,000 hours rule. for instance, the french quote thing, that could take 3 days, the first date, the second to ask what he favorite poem is, and the last. keeping in mind that it is established that he mines her for personal facts. second, the things shown were just one instance. one ice sculpture, a  
Groundhog day isn't very specific, but this article is pretty cool and suggests a total of 33 years and 350 days. Edge of Tomorrow is way less clear, but in the novel, All You Need is Kill, he keeps track of the days on the back of his hand and the total gets up to 393. 
Day 1: Batman jumps through a skylight and tackles him to the ground. Day 2: Batman gets a face full of buckshot as he's falling. It may take a few days for Phil to adapt for lousy aim/timing, and making sure Batman isn't tipped off about his plan in advance that day (like if he's tailing Phil when he gets the gun). Overall, wouldn't take much. </p>
