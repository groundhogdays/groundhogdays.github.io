Groundhog Day is particularly tied to Candlemas Day, which falls on February 2nd. This day marked the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox.

But if you‚Äôre going to Groundhog Day a rum-based drink, this is the one. Recipe courtesy of food writer Lauren Van Mullem. They Perfectly Proportioned Mai Tai.

This drink was made famous by the movie Groundhog Day (1993) starring Bill Murray as weatherman Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as his producer Rita.

Highlighted as Rita‚Äôs favorite drink in the 1993 movie ‚ÄúGroundhog Day,‚Äù the simple Sweet Vermouth on the Rocks with a Twist, has become a staple drink to make for every enthusiast out there.

At first, Harold Ramis‚Äô GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray‚Äôs sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. 
Rita‚Äôs favorite drink, a Sweet Vermouth on the Rocks with a Twist, is actually a minor character in the film. The first time we meet the cocktail, the crew is stuck in town due to car trouble, as well as an impending snowstorm. There‚Äôs nothing to do but wait it out. Phil finds Rita at the local bar, where he offers to buy her a drink.
