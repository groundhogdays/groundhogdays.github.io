        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) - Goofs on IMDb - bloopers, mistakes, errors in continuity, plot holes, anachronisms, spoilers and more. 
So I just realized the other day while watching Groundhog Day After Phil goes off the cliff in the truck with the groundhog, it explodes. One would think as it exploded, Phil would die. So it falls, and then Larry says, 'he might be ok'. Then it explodes, which we can probably say Phil just died, and Larry continues to say 'well maybe not'. 
Groundhog Day is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and its legacy has long-been established. The movie has earned consistent and endless praise for its performances, cozy small-town atmosphere, unique time loop concept, and near pitch-perfect screenplay. 
The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58

Sorry for the hostile response to your fun post. Modern film criticism has been ruined by finding plot holes (usually just plot contrivances or poor character decisions) and blowing them out of proportion in order to label a movie as "objectively bad." Thankfully people have noticed this but are now wary when people mention the word. 
As wonderful a movie as Groundhog Day is, it never explains the nature of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) being trapped in a time loop.  8 Sequels That Fixed Movie Plot Holes 10 More Film Secrets  
No plot hole at all. Even if he skipped the ceremony and drove back to Pittsburgh, at 6:00am the next day, he would have woken up back in Punxsutawney. Re: Major plot hole 
Groundhog Day is maybe the most philosophical and interesting of all the comedies that involve someone getting a piano dropped on them. Bill Murray relives one day in his life, for seemingly no purpose, over and over. Due to the lack of explanation in the finished film, people have argued for years about what the heck the point of it all is.

Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
"Rubin had also originally envisioned Andie MacDowell's character Rita reliving the day with Phil, and portrayed the pair as being stuck together in the time loop for far longer than the film showed, possibly for thousands of years (Phil tracked time by reading a page of a book each day and had managed to read through the entire public library)." 
Another notable mention is Happy Death Day, a thrilling horror-comedy where a college student must solve her own murder within a repeating day, mirroring the self-improvement journey seen in Groundhog Day. These examples illustrate how the list combines the familiar with fresh twists to deliver a captivating viewing experience. 
My theory; piano teacher lady is also reliving groundhog day, and that's why she takes pride in having taught him everything. She taught him over those 10 or so years or however much time he needed, and she really would take pride in herself from that. 
“That’s a true fact regarding the origins of Groundhog Day in that it was more of a groundhog hunt.” 21. The scene where Phil abducts the groundhog and lets the animal drive took several takes.
