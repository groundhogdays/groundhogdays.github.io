        <p>If Lander Lil "sees" a shadow on Groundhog Day, then more winter is expected. How Punxsutawney Phil fared Overall, 14 of the groundhogs had 50% accuracy or better. 
*Note that some groundhogs did not make predictions every year in the past 20 years. Special Mention: Punxsatawney Phil. Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. 
NOAA released the study ahead of Groundhog Day, which falls on Sunday, to analyze which groundhogs -- along with one prairie dog statue and a tortoise -- were the most accurate in predicting  
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here&amp;#039;s how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
Phil's accuracy was just 35% f rom 2005 to 2024, according to data compiled by NOAA.  Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. 
Groundhog Day celebrations around the country. Each year, Phil draws about 20,000 people to the Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler’s Knob in the Pennsylvania Wilds outside of Punxsutawney  
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club takes care of Phil year-round, and on each Feb. 2, members of the club's Inner Circle rouse Phil at sunrise (this year he emerged at 7:25 a.m. EST) to see if he  
Every Feb. 2, the world's most famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil rises from its burrow in Pennsylvania for Groundhog Day to give the prediction on what type of weather the U.S. could expect to  
In the near term, the groundhog’s accuracy rate is slightly worse. According to the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, Phil has been right about 30% of the time over the past decade. ANIMALS OTHER THAN PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL THAT WILL TRY TO PREDICT END OF WINTER ON GROUNDHOG DAY. In 2021, Phil predicted more winter. 
FiveThirtyEight, a data journalism website, has created a visualization illustrating how often Punxsutawney Phil, a groundhog in Pennsylvania, made an accurate prediction on Groundhog Day from 1994 to 2021. According to legend, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow on the morning of February 2, winter will continue for six more weeks. 
No, Groundhog Day weather predictions are not scientifically accurate: There is no evidence that a groundhog emerging from hibernation has any ability to forecast the weather over the next 6 weeks. Groundhog Day is based on superstition, folklore, and legend, not meteorological science. 
While Groundhog Day is primarily celebrated in North America, variations of the tradition can be found in other parts of the world, with different animals used for weather predictions. Conclusion. Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition that continues to capture the hearts and imaginations of people across North America and beyond. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Penn. - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is the Mecca for those around the country celebrating Groundhog Day. Every year, on Feb. 2, tens of thousands of people flock to this small town of less than 6,000 people some 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, to see whether the town's rodent

Here's what the weather forecast shows for Punxsutawney Phil's prediction for Groundhog Day on Sunday morning.  Phil's accuracy was just 35% from 2005 to 2024,  
In 1979, the Ohio legislature named him the official groundhog for the Buckeye State, per Groundhog-Day.com. How accurate is Phil? How accurate is Chuck? 
Here's the forecast for Sunday morning: Cloudy conditions and chilly temperatures in the upper-20s are expected in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania when Phil makes his prediction around 7:08 a.m. ET  
As most weather-minded people know, today (Feb. 2) is Groundhog Day. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, the creature will leave the burrow
