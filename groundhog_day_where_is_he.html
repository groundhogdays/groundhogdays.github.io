        <p>When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. More: Where to watch Bill Murray's 1993 classic movie 'Groundhog Day' for Groundhog Day. What is  
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
He made this proclamation on Groundhog Day, February 2. Phil's fame quickly spread, and newspapers worldwide began reporting his Groundhog Day predictions. 
In the American tradition of Groundhog Day, the nation’s groundhog prognosticators take a stance on the season ahead. If the groundhog sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. 
Our Groundhog Day is a remote survivor of that belief. Though we recognize animal behavior isn’t the only way to judge planting dates, the tradition continues, often with a wink and a smile. Here at The Old Farmer’s Almanac , we say, “If the groundhog sees his shadow, we’ll have six more weeks of winter; if he doesn’t, it’ll be six  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray. In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
Groundhog Day By Numbers. 1841 – A storekeeper named James Morris wrote and marked the date February 2 as Candlemas Day. 40,000 – The number of people who attend the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 1886 – The year the first Groundhog Day was held in Punxsutawney. 
Where is the groundhog kept? On the 364 days when Punxsutawney Phil isn't working (sweet job if you can get it!), he lives in a terrarium called Phil's Burrow inside the Punxsutawney Library. 
When it comes to Groundhog Day, Pennsylvanians know there is only one authoritative voice in rodent prognostication. And that voice is Punxsutawney Phil, who makes his home at Gobbler’s Knob in  
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated every year on February 2? Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition for many as they wait to see how long winter will last. As the legend goes, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it's a forecast of an early spring. 
"Today the Germans say the groundhog comes out of his winter quarters," read the diary entry, "and if he sees his shadow he returns in and remains there 40 days." 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The annual event has its origin in a German legend about a furry rodent. It roots back to Candlemas Day in Europe with the Christian "festival of lights" that falls on Feb. 2, midway between the  
He is noted as the official groundhog meteorologist of New York City who predicts the duration of winter each February 2 on Groundhog Day. He makes the prediction based on whether or not he sees his shadow at 7:30 a.m. on Groundhog Day. The ceremony at the zoo is often attended and officiated by the Mayor of New York City. 
Beau is no ordinary groundhog — he’s the South’s official weather prognosticator, continuing a tradition that started in 1981.  Groundhog Day traces its roots to ancient Celtic traditions  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
On the next Groundhog Day, he finally admits he made promises he couldn’t keep because he was trying to please everyone and makes amends.” I love this book because it addresses so many age appropriate issues about friendship, honesty and making and keeping promises.
