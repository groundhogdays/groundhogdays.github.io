While this is a folklore many have heard since they were a kid, many aren’t familiar with how Groundhog Day became such a favored tradition. The first known record of Groundhog Day, which originated from a German legend, was in a local paper in 1886 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Well, its origin is a lot more bizarre than you think.  While the Groundhog Day tradition as we know it today started in 1887, Phil has been making his predictions since 1886.
