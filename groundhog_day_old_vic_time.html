Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by  working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time,  the production at The Old Vic in  
Groundhog Day. When the grumpy, arrogant and cynical Pittsburg TV weather man Phil is sent to a remote Pennsylvania town to report on an animal that apparently forecasts the weather, he makes the journey reluctantly. He has already covered the story four times before, and he's sick to death of it. But this time is different. Horribly different. 
Based on the 1993 film of the same name, the show follows the story of Phil Connors, a cynical TV weatherman who gets caught in a time loop whilst covering 5 Things You Need to Know About Groundhog Day | Old Vic Theatre 
It’s a musical audiences wanted to see again, and again, and again and now Tim Minchin’s Groundhog Day is back at the Old Vic Theatre for a second, strictly limited season in summer 2023. Phil Connors isn’t a great guy, but sometimes things can change. 
Warchus brings Groundhog Day to the Old Vic as part of his inaugural season as Artistic Director, with performances due to begin in July, playing until September 17th 2016. Don’t miss out on this entirely original, exciting new musical! Child Friendly. Groundhog Day is packed with plenty of laughs, but may not be suitable for very young children.

Groundhog Day will be performed at the Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August, with a press performance on 8 June. The show has received critical acclaim during its initial run, being described by Sarah Crompton as “a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving.” 
Dispatched with novice producer Rita (Tanisha Spring) to smalltown Punxsutawny, Pennsylvania, where a groundhog predicts the weather every February 2nd, Phil puts the moves on anyone female and  
A review of Groundhog Day, the musical version by Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin on at the Old Vic until August 2023. Better than the original!

There's a sense of deja vu at the Old Vic at the moment but don't worry - you're not stuck in a loop, it's just Groundhog Day returning there after 7 long years.
