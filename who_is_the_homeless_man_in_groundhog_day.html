        <p>Given you were understandably likely bawling your eyes out, you may have missed a little nod hidden in the Groundhog Day scene where Phil tries to save the old homeless man from dying. 
The old homeless man is in poor health, so Phil takes him to the hospital. Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita. 
The real question is whether each day, he made sure the man was inside, warm and fed before he died. Or did he go back to ignoring him. Or did he scoop him up and take him to the hospital and get him checked out so when, I assume his heart gives out, he has help at hand.

What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while trapped in this time loop. 
He meets an old homeless man,and after learning it is his last day, he contributes the next one to making the last day of his life the best yet and attempting to save him, but he still ends up dying. Each day afterward, he runs “errands” consisting of helping people around town, and before he knows it, he is the most popular man in  
Happy Groundhog Day, everybody! Punxsutawney Phil did NOT see his shadow on Tuesday, meaning we're going to have an early spring  When Phil tries to save the homeless man. 
Roger Ebert didn't initially give Groundhog Day a glowing review. Following that, Groundhog Day was hailed by spiritual leaders, and he gave a re-review in which he honestly said he needed to look a little deeper to really appreciate what the movie really was able to do. 
The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment. He could relieve the day a million times the man is going to die each time. 
Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual.
