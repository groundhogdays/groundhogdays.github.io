        <p>First, we'll learn more about when spring will start on Groundhog Day this weekend. Then comes Valentine's Day. And not long after that is Presidents Day, also known as George Washington's birthday, on Monday, Feb. 17. So, what’s open and closed on Presidents Day 2025? Who gets a day off on  
That means USPS is required to observe all federal holidays. All post offices will be closed, and mail will not be delivered on MLK Day, President's Day, Columbus Day, and all other federal holidays. If New Year's Day falls on a Saturday, the preceding day will be observed as a federal holiday. This occurred on January 1st, 2022. 
Christmas Day Thursday, December 25 *For holidays falling on Saturday, Federal Reserve banks and branches will be open the preceding Friday; however, the Board of Governors will be closed. 
Groundhog Day may be a big occasion in Pennsylvania, but is not significant enough to warrant a dedicated federla holiday.  Since Groundhog Day is not a federal holiday, banks and post offices  
An example of this is Inauguration Day, on which banks in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area might close, or Patriot Day in Massachusetts. Your bank might be closed on these days, or they  
Keep in mind that even though these banks are open, the Federal Reserve is closed, so any transactions received on those dates will be posted the following business day. BANK HOLIDAY OPEN 
Also, some institutions—particularly online banks—may not observe holidays that fall on a weekend and remain open during their regular weekday hours. Bank of America: Bank of America is closed for all federal holidays in 2024. Check your local branch for specific days and hours of operation. Chase Bank: The nation's largest bank stays open  
Smaller financial institutions typically are closed for all observed bank holidays.  New Year's Day: Monday: Closed Jan 15: Martin Luther King Day: Monday: Closed  
City National Bank will be closed on Monday, Feb. 17, 2025 in observance of Presidents Day. The U.S. Federal Reserve Banks will also be closed for this national holiday. Are Banks Open Today? 
Banks are closed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Monday, Jan. 20. In 2025, there are 11 federal holidays observed by the Federal Reserve, which regulates the United States banking system. 
For example, if Independence Day lands on a Sunday, banks are closed on July 5. In 2024, that isn’t a concern: No federal holidays fall on Sundays this year. 
The Cherry Street Inn from “Groundhog Day” Bill Murray plays a weatherman who goes to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but the movie was actually filmed in Woodstock, Illinois, about an hour northwest of Chicago. 
FirstBank branches will be closed in honor of the following holidays: New Year’s: January 1, 2025 Martin Luther King Jr. Day: January 20, 2025 Presidents Day: February 17, 2025 Memorial Day: May 26, 2025 Juneteenth: June 19, 2025 Independence Day: July 4, 2025 Labor Day: September 1, 2025 Columbus Day/Indigenous People Day: October 13, 2025 
Even when brick-and-mortar facilities are closed, some post office services are available online 24/7, including on holidays. With a USPS.com account, you can order stamps, print shipping labels, order boxes and other mail supplies, and request package pickups. 
An example of this is Inauguration Day, on which banks in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area might close, or Patriot Day in Massachusetts. Your bank might be closed on these days, or they  
Banks: Most banks will be closed on Presidents Day. Branches of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, PNC, Truist and more will not open their branches on Jan. 19.  Groundhog Day  
The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
For instance, banks are closed on Veterans Day banks and the NYSE is open. And on Good Friday, banks are generally open and the stock market is closed. Online accessibility on Federal Reserve bank
