        <p>The Doug Liman-directed adaptation of “All You Need Is Kill” gave an action sci-fi spin on the Groundhog Day concept. In this time loop movie, Tom Cruise stars as a cowardly military PR  
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
There’s something about Chris! Ultra funny and legendary actor, Chris Elliott, stops by Couch Surfing this week to discuss his most beloved roles, from ‘Grou

Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Small things like lighting, music, camera angles, the look on an actor's face etc can make a massive difference as to whether a movie comes across as a horror or a comedy. Given that Groundhog Day was made by some of the finest comic veterans in the industry, I think it's a fair bet to say that it was never meant to be a horror movie. 
Seemingly not done with big-screen laughs based on big-time gross humor, Elliott played a supporting part in the Wayans Brothers' 2001 parody Scary Movie 2, the sequel to their breakout horror  
This carefully curated list brings together the best movies that deliver the magical narrative style reminiscent of Groundhog Day.Each recommendation has been handpicked and then further refined by the enthusiastic votes of Ranker fans like you, ensuring that it resonates with audiences who enjoy the unique blend of humor and existential themes. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
The film is existentialist, the basic metaphor is that most people are stuck in the same place for the rest of their lives. At one point a Phil explains his situation of being trapped in a single day to two other characters, and one responds "that about sums it up for me." 
Well, the obvious answer is Palm Springs, which I'm sure's been mentioned 27 times already. a kind of surreal and well executed concept Stranger than Fiction. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
Happy Death Day: Directed by Christopher Landon. With Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Ruby Modine, Charles Aitken. A college student must relive the day of her murder over and over again, in a loop that will end only when she discovers her killer's identity. 
Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. Even though I have seen this movie a million times, it’s still as funny and brilliant as the first time I saw it in theaters back in 1993.
