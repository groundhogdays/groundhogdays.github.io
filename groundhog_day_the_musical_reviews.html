        <p>Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
As per the classic 1993 film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day takes place on a very big day in a very small Pennsylvanian town. Each year on February 2, a large rodent emerges from his burrow  
Broadway Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ The Musical.  Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are  
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
Below, check out our Groundhog Day Musical review. Rubin, who co-wrote the original film, adapted it into a stage play last year when it debuted at The Old Vic in London. Nothing has changed about  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical.Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." 
The musical Groundhog Day is far more reflective of Minchin’s comedy than anyone else’s, it even manages to work in a musical dig at alternative therapies almost apropos of nothing, to really  
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day, the Olivier Award-winning new musical featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchinand a book by Danny Rubin, and directed by Matthew Warchus, opens tonight, Monday April 17, on  
Groundhog Day on Broadway has received nominations for SEVEN Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Original Score and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical for Andy Karl; FIVE Outer Critics Circle Award nominations; TWO Drama League Award nominations and a Drama Desk Award nomination. 
Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl. 
It’s Phil’s journey more than his destination that makes “Groundhog Day” such joy, as Mr. Karl — previously seen as the punch-drunk title contendah of the “Rocky” musical — gives  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
What happened to the national tour of Groundhog Day the Musical? After a successful Broadway run, Groundhog Day was slated to begin an 18-month national tour in 2018. So what happened? According to Playbill, the tour was unceremoniously canceled in January 2018. Composer and lyricist Tim Minchin weighed in, saying “Sadly (despicably) there  
Seven years after its premiere, the Groundhog Day musical is back at the Old Vic. Andy Karl is still playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors, condemned to relive a single day over and over. And I still love it. 
Groundhog Day, a new musical about a man who must experience the same day over and over until he gets it right, opens August 16 at London's Old Vic Theatre. Based on the popular 1993 film comedy  
Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin.  Due to huge public demand and rave reviews, the production extended by  
At the center of San Francisco Playhouse’s first regional premiere of Broadway’s Groundhog Day the Musical is the brilliant, perfectly cast Ryan Drummond, playing local TV news weatherman, Phil.
