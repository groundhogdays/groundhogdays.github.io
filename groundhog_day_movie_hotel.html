        <h2><strong>groundhog day movie hotel groundhog day in cursive</strong></h2>
        <p>What a nice post to read today. Every time it’s groundhog day, this movie always comes to mind. It’s such a funny comedy and I can’t get enough of it. Especially because of Bill Murray. He’s such a funny actor. Thanks for letting us take a peek inside the actual house. It’s such a beautiful place, but I prefer the movie sets. 
Experience for yourself why all of our guest ratings are 5 stars since opening in 2017. Great food is prepared by award winning cooks and every detail of your stay is looked after by our attentive team. You may recognize our home from “Groundhog Day”. Yes, this is where Bill Murray stayed. Same house, yet anything but stuffy and repetitive! 
Movie The Cherry Tree Inn, located in Woodstock, Illinois, is a charming bed-and-breakfast best known for its role in the 1993 film Groundhog Day. In the movie, the inn is portrayed as the fictional "Cherry Street Inn," where Bill Murray's character, Phil Connors, repeatedly wakes up each morning as he relives the same day over and over. 
Groundhog Day activities at the bed and breakfast include a movie watch party, private tours, trivia, bingo, cocktails, and a dinner party, per their website. With a population of approximately 25,000 people, the town of Woodstock also offers an ample number of festivities to choose from, including screenings of "Groundhog Day," walking tours  
Located right around the corner from our famed Cherry Tree Inn B&amp;B which is the original home from the Groundhog Day movie and just two blocks from Woodstock Square, this is the oldest Victorian B&amp;B in town. The Cherry Branch Guest House features three guest suites complete with private baths and walk in showers. 
You should also know that each room also comes with a DVD player and a copy of Groundhog Day. The 4 Suites of Cherry Tree. Let's start with the suite that is actually inside the home's turret, The Black Walnut Suite. This room features a four-poster bed and views of the archway seen in the movie. Next, is The Cherry Blossom Suite. This is the  
Whether you’re a die-hard Groundhog Day fan or simply looking for a unique and relaxing getaway, the Cherry Tree Inn Bed &amp; Breakfast offers an experience like no other. Relive the magic of the movie while creating new memories in the heart of Woodstock, a town that perfectly embodies the charm of small-town America. 
If you’re looking for a fun thing to do, I’d recommend doing a self-guided Groundhog Day movie walking tour. All the movie spots have plaques to indicate where it took place. The Cherry Tree Inn has one too!Look for the Groundhog Day plaque on the arch as you walk to the front of the home. Final Thoughts of Cherry Tree Inn 
The best bed and breakfasts offer a sense of familiarity that feels like home. At Cherry Tree Inn Bed and Breakfast, that sense of deja vu is expected since it&amp;#039;s the place where Bill Murray woke up over, and over, and over in the movie Groundhog Day. 
If you've seen the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, you may recognize Cherry Tree Inn Bed and Breakfast where Bill Murray's character Phil stayed. This picturesque Victorian is far more than a film location, however. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
This is where the events of the movie "Groundhog Day" take place, where Phil finds himself stuck in a time loop reliving the same day over and over again. The town of Pittsburgh serves as the setting for the film's storyline and is where Phil experiences his repeated days until he learns the lessons needed to break free from the cycle.
