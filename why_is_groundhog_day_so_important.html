But the groundhog was important to many native nations that lived on these lands for centuries before the arrival of peoples from the Old World.  And so, on this Groundhog Day and on the ones

This quirky tradition, known as Groundhog Day, has captured the hearts and imaginations of generations. But where did this unusual custom come from, and why has it endured for so long? In this article, we‘ll delve into the rich history of Groundhog Day, exploring its ancient roots, early celebrations, and modern-day significance. 
The History of Groundhog Day. The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
And what does February 2nd have to do with it? But Groundhog Day actually has deep roots in a much older Christian tradition. Furthermore, the day that we celebrate Groundhog's Day has some real meteorological significance, designating the halfway point between two important markers in the changing of the seasons (via EarthSky.) 
He has a theory for why Groundhog Day became, and remains, so popular in the U.S. "Throughout history, whenever there has been a real strong emphasis on science, its counterpart of intuition, instinct, emotion, imagination — the right side of our brain — pushes back a little bit," Harman says, explaining that Groundhog Day took off right

However, the idea that a groundhog predicting the weather can seem bizarre, but perhaps the answer to this event can be found in its 134-year history. As stated, Groundhog Day has been a holiday in America for over a century, 
So, you go, Phil! See your shadow, don’t see your shadow and we will still gather every year to watch Bill Murray in the masterful movie tribute to your life’s work—where he has to live the same day over and over again until he learns an important lesson. Which we all have to do. It’s official!
