The pronunciation is mostly wrong and the words are mumbled. Maybe it sounds French enough to fool the director and the producers of the movie But not me. P. P.-S. And it’s not old French poetry, the poem is inspired by the song La bourrée du célibataire by Jacques Brel (translated as Bachelor’s Dance). « La fille que j’aimera » is

La citation est en fait tirée de la chanson "La bourrée du célibataire" de Jacques Brel. Jacques Brel, né le 8 avril 1929 à Schaerbeek, Belgique, et mort le  
The scene where Bill recites French poetry to a surprised Rita was filmed in a Bavarian restaurant in Chicago, just like the scene where he saves the weather forecaster from a heart attack. The woman to whom Phil lights a cigarette is Lindsay Albert, the wife of the film’s producer, Trevor Albert. 
- Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. - La fille qui j'aimerai sera comme bon vin qui se bonifiera un peu chaque matin. - You speak French! - Oui. - I haven't done this since I was a kid. - Me neither. It's fun! - It's good, clean fun. - I hope that one day I can do this with my own children. - Where'd you get that? 
Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. You speak French! I haven't done this since I was a kid. Me neither. It's fun! Clean fun. I hope one day I can do this with my own children. Where'd you get that? Well, I went over to the snowman shop. Hey, an assassin! I'll protect you! I shall die for you. You shall not take her! Find  
- Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. - What a waste of time! - I mean, for someone else that would be an incredible waste of time. - So bold of you to choose that. It's incredible. You must be a very, very strong person. - I think people place too much emphasis on their careers. Gosh, I wish we could all live in the mountains.

Groundhog Day - French Poetry: Phil (Bill Murray) impresses Rita (Andie MacDowell) at the end of a series of deja vu dates by consuming increasing knowledge  
Groundhog Day refers to the yin/yang cycle (at the heart of the Zodiac) that mankind has endured for hundreds of thousands of years (aka glaciation cycle). Koyaanisqatsi reveals that when sped up, you can see how mankind’s multi-millennial day becomes perceptible as a day of mere hours. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
The wretch, concentred all in self,Living, shall forfeit fair renown,And, doubly dying, shall go downTo the vile dust, from whence he sprung,Unwept, unhonour 
RITA: Believe it or not, I studied 19th Century French poetry. Phil's first reaction is to think poetry is a total waste of time. But after he realizes this response won't win Rita over, he goes out and learns how to speak French just to impress her. Rita is no fool though. She eventually sees through Phil's attempts to get her into bed with him. 
OF COURSE I do not own this. Just thought it was cool. 
For a little bit of Black Comedy, the montage of Rita slapping Phil day after day (sort of), even though it leads directly to his Despair Event Horizon. When Rita first reveals she majored in Nineteenth Century French Poetry, Phil can't help guffawing and exclaim, "What a complete waste of time!" 
The French poetry, which at first he can’t stop himself from [laughs] from laughing out loud Wes: Yeah. Erin: over Rita’s study of 19th century french poetry in which, in the iteration after that, he quotes some sort of fake french poetry to her the following day.
