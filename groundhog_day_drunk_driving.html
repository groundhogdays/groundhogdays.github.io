The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre,  After spending a night in jail for a drunk driving crash, Phil is returned peacefully to  
Phil's response to being arrested for driving recklessly with the groundhog reflects his character development throughout the film "Groundhog Day." At the beginning, he is arrogant and self-centered, believing himself to be above consequences. However, as he relives the same day over and over, he learns humility and begins to care for others.
