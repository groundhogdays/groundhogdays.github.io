        <h2><strong>is groundhog day accurate reddit groundhog day guitar chords</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is real, in the sense that there is a real holiday and there is a real ceremony. Whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow has no actual bearing on how much longer winter weather lasts, but it's a fun tradition. It has yet to be proven whether Bill Murray actually spent 
Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd in the US, is a time-honored tradition of forecasting the weather based on the behavior of a groundhog. Despite its widespread popularity, the accuracy of the groundhog's predictions is a matter of debate, with statistics showing that they are correct only 40% of the time. 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
The NOAA recently posted a Grading the Groundhogs study on their website, which they wrote is “in honor of Groundhog Day and in the spirit of fun,” comparing the accuracy of Groundhog Day  
This year, NOAA took a deeper dive into Groundhog Day results and graded the work of 19 groundhogs and groundhog surrogates to determine the accuracy of their predictions. Spoiler: Phil came in  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Penn. - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is the Mecca for those around the country celebrating Groundhog Day. Every year, on Feb. 2, tens of thousands of people flock to this small town of less than 6,000 people some 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, to see whether the town's rodent  
Before we get into the shadows of how accurate Phil can be, let’s take a look at the history of the holiday. Groundhog Day has both Pagan and Christian roots all the way back to the 18 th and 19  
The tradition is that whatever the weather is like on St Swithin's Day - whether rain or sunshine - it will continue for the next 40 days and 40 nights. It's of course a load of superstitious clap trap. 
NOAA released the study ahead of Groundhog Day, which falls on Sunday, to analyze which groundhogs -- along with one prairie dog statue and a tortoise -- were the most accurate in predicting  
This day (from sunset Feb 1 to Sunset Feb 2) is actually an ancient pagan celebration day known as Imbolc (or so I have been told). It marks halfway between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox. It was associated with a goddess called Brigid, and the Catholic church took it over and changed it to St. Bridget's day. 
Well it was a bit tricky with groundhog day so I had to watch it many times over in order to figure it out. Trust me after you watch groundhog day for the 6th time in one weekend you feel like your head is spinning. 
According to Groundhog Day organizers, the rodents' forecasts are accurate 75% to 90% of the time. However, a Canadian study for 13 cities in the past 30 to 40 years found that the weather patterns predicted on Groundhog Day were only 37% accurate over that time period—a value not significant compared to the 33% that could occur by chance. 
Yeah, but why didn't that happen the day before, or two days before? It's implied that Phil has been doing this "perfect day" for quite a while. Reply reply

It's not the rager it once was before they banned alcohol and is for sure more kid/family friendly now. There are more skits and music made for kids. I miss the old groundhog day. Make sure to consider also taking time to find all of the hidden ground hog statues throughout the town. 
At 78% accuracy, 11 out of 14, Bart has the highest accuracy of any groundhog-ish prognosticator in North America, but it should be noted that Bart has made fewer predictions than many of the others on the list. At No. 36, Punxsutawney Phil is historically not so accurate. 
I think you kinda missed the point of the movie. Phil is a horrible, immoral person. He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person. 
Except for the year the groundhog bit a politician who was looking for a photo op, causing him to drop the animal who died later that day from its injuries. No need to torture confused animals for an annual public spectacle that lasts less than a minute. Time to let this tradition die along with that poor groundhog. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. </p>
