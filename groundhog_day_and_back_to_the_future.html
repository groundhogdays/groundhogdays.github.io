I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right. On top of my head I can think about Back to the Future and Edge of Tomorrow. Do you know any similar movies? Thank you. 
So it’s more Groundhog Day than Back to the Future, but still employs an element of time travel. The movie is about a 14-year-old, Pete (played by Zachary Gordon) who feels overlooked by his parents and left out. 
The character's titular day off makes a comedic adventure as enjoyably uplifting as the one in Back to the Future, with an equally unforgettable car at the center of it, and, while there's no time travel or life-and-death stakes, it still has plenty of variation in terms of tone and style throughout.

So I love time travel movies, but it's been a while since I've seen one. Short list of movies I've already watched and liked: Tenet, Primer, the Back to the future series, the Terminators, 12 monkeys, Looper, Edge of Tomorrow, Donnie Darko, Groundhog Day, Arrival, Interstellar etc 
Although "Back to the Future" is more of an action-adventure film, "Groundhog Day" is firmly rooted in humor and takes full advantage of Murray's unparalleled comedic timing. 
Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks nap, but if the day be cloudy he remains out, as the weather is to be moderate. </p>
