        <p>Groundhog Day is playing at the Princess Theatre until April 20. This production is a Melbourne exclusive and won’t be travelling interstate. Tickets are on sale now and you can get yours here . 
Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl. 
Groundhog Day The Musical is perfection - 5 Stars! Fun and witty, with elements of dark humour, yet also philosophically heart-warming. This musical provides an excellent psychological examination  
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
Review by Naomi CardwellThe arrival of Groundhog Day: The Musical in Melbourne has me nervous. Tim Minchin’s epic production about a TV weatherman with a god complex has blown in on a storm of accolades by way of London and Broadway, following the runaway success of Minchin and director Matthew Warchus’ brainchild Matilda the Musical. But musicals based on films seem like a reversal of  
Groundhog Day the Musical currently playing at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre delivers an outstanding and captivating performance that leaves the audience thoroughly entertained. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the beloved film seamlessly blends humor, heart, and catchy tunes to create an unforgettable experience. 
A production like ‘Groundhog Day’, which plays with an interesting, clever premise. . . Is the perfect place for Tim Minchin to be. He’s totally in tune and totally up for the task, creating a soundtrack that captured the chaos of repetition without being annoying, and instead being head-shakingly intelligent. 
Content warning: this review contains references to self-harm and suicide. Phil Connors, the protagonist of Groundhog Day – both in the original 1993 film and in the musical theatre version – is condemned to live the same day over and over again until he learns some fundamental truths about himself, and figures out how he can become a better human being. 
Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors and in the story of this show, Andy Karl has been Phil Connors since the beginning. It may just be that no one else could play this role as well as Andy Karl and given he has opened this show in London on two different occasions, in New York and now in Melbourne, there’s certainly no one more  
Fast forward to 2016, and the film becomes a London musical stage production with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin to rave reviews and audience responses. Fast-forward to 2024, and it is finally Melbourne's opportunity to see this award wining play, and the wait has definitely been worth it. 
It's been 30 years since the movie Groundhog Day was released, where a cynical weatherman wakes up to find that he's stuck in a time loop, repeating the same day over and over and over again. The audience gets to watch his journey of personal growth before finally breaking this repetitive soul destroying cycle. 
The Australian company of GWB Entertainment’s Groundhog Day The Musical will welcome their first audiences this week at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, the production will play an exclusive 13-week season in Melbourne with sold out preview performances from Wednesday 24  
And of course, it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is back in the role of Phil Connors at the Old Vic, where he and the show won rave reviews in 2016, only for the subsequent New York run

Groundhog Day the Musical currently playing at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre delivers an outstanding and captivating performance that leaves the audience thoroughly entertained. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the beloved film seamlessly blends humor, heart, and catchy tunes to create an unforgettable experience. 
Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
‘Groundhog Day’’s staging was a hell of a lot of fun. Smooth, dynamic and effective, scenes came alive with ease – a car chase at the height of Phil’s insanity was a particularly fun ride, using lighting and perspective to wow audiences who responded with rapturous applause.

Groundhog Day the Musical has ended it’s 13-week season at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Phil Connors, a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Caught in a time loop, he’s forced to relive the same day again and again and again. 
Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors and in the story of this show, Andy Karl has been Phil Connors since the beginning.
