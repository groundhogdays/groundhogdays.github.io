Here are my top 3 tips on how to get yourself out of a rut and get rid of feeling like you’re experiencing Groundhog day. 1. 
In the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a grouchy weatherman covering Groundhog Day in small-town Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Because as we face the actual Groundhog Day this year, the truth is that many of us can feel like we’re stuck in a mental or emotional Groundhog Day, just like Murray. We can feel like we’re spinning our wheels. We can feel like we’re just going through the motions. We can feel like we are powerless to change our circumstances. 
The COVID-19 crisis will come to an end—the ultra-positive vaccine news feels like a light at the end of the tunnel—and time will return to normal. And when it does, I hope I never again take for granted the tiny markers that help separate one day from the next. Until then, from my family to yours: happy March 265 th.

9. How do you stop the groundhogs from chasing people on skis? Take away their skis. 10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13. 
I feel like this at the moment. Life just feels relentless and sometimes it's too much. People say do new things etc etc but life is hard when you don't have much money. It's just week after week of work and struggling to get by. The happiest moments are spent watching my neice and nephews play. They just love life.
