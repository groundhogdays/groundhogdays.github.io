If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." 
Groundhog Day: the musical is based on the 1993 film starring Bill Murray as TV weatherman Phil Connors who arrives at smalltown Punxsutawney in the US to report on the 2 February ceremony where villagers hope a groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil won’t see his shadow, signifying an end of winter and the start of spring.
