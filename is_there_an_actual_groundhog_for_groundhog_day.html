        <h2><strong>is there an actual groundhog for groundhog day groundhog day premise</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
German settlers arriving in the U.S. quickly found out there were no badgers in Pennsylvania, so they went with the groundhog instead. The real reason the groundhog comes out on February 2 has  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
life.The spectacle of Groundhog Day is the groundhog’s interaction with its shadow. According to legend, if the groundhog sees its shadow and retreats to its burrow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. On the other hand, if the day is cloudy and the groundhog doesn’t see its shadow, then an early spring is predicted. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Whether you‘re a true believer in Phil‘s prognosticating powers or simply enjoy the spectacle of it all, there‘s no denying the charm and humor of Groundhog Day. So this February 2nd, join the crowds at Gobbler‘s Knob (or tune in from the comfort of your own burrow) and raise a toast to Punxsutawney Phil, the weather-predicting wonder. 
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
If there's no shadow, that's a sign of an early spring. What is Groundhog Day? Groundhog Day is an "unusual holiday," according to the Farmers Almanac, that dates back centuries to European  
If you’re looking for something a little different to break the monotony of the winter season, here are some fun and unique ways to celebrate Groundhog Day. 1. Watch Groundhog Day—and Live It Like Bill Murray! Let’s be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray’s comedic  
Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned Ryserson, in the movie Groundhog Day, attended the 2010 Groundhog Day Celebration in Punxsutawney. Danny Rubin, writer of the screenplay Groundhog Day, attended Groundhog Day 2013. This was the first time he attend Groundhog Day since before the movie was released. 
This was exactly six weeks after February 2. Assuming that the equinox marked the first day of spring in certain medieval cultures, as it does now in Western countries, Groundhog Day occurred exactly six weeks before spring. Therefore, if the groundhog saw his shadow on Groundhog Day there would be six more weeks of winter. 
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
Groundhog Day is Sunday, and now is a good time to familiarize yourself before you check out the annual weather forecasting festivals in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Here's what you need  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
12. The film ‘Groundhog Day’ popularized the celebration. Previously, few thousands of people would travel to Gobbler’s Knob to celebrate Groundhog Day. The release of the 1993 Columbia Pictures film, ‘Groundhog Day’ starring Bill Murray made the celebration of this tradition quite popular. The number of tourists that visited
