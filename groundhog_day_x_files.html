        <p>"Monday" is the fourteenth episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on February 28, 1999. It was written by Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, directed by Kim Manners, and featured guest appearances by Carrie Hamilton and Darren E. Burrows. 
Monday: Directed by Kim Manners. With David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, Carrie Hamilton. A woman desperately attempts to change the outcome of the events of a day she is forced to relive again and again in which her boyfriend explodes a bomb during a failed bank robbery killing everyone inside, including Mulder and Scully. 
"Monday" is the fourteenth episode of the sixth season of The X-Files. It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on February 28, 1999. The episode was written by Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, and was directed by Kim Manners. Monday is a "Monster-of-the-week" story, independent of the series' mythology arc. A woman is trapped in an endlessly repeating time loop that ends in a  
"Groundhog Day" Loop: They are trapped in the time loop, and only one person is aware of it. Mulder and Scully only experience brief moments of deja-vu. Unfortunately for them, it happens to be on the very same day Scully is stuck in "the longest meeting in FBI history" and Mulder is having the best damn day of his life. 
Just watched it. The episode where the woman is in a sort of groundhog day and her boyfriend robs a bank, setting off explosives and killing everyone inside. The day repeats over and over, and only the woman knows its repeating. Mulder and Scully have no idea, so the woman attempts to convince Mulder to change the outcome. 
This is one of the greats. I love the way it was filmed, excellent for a TV show back in the 90's. The deja-vu sequences were awesome. This is the X-Files take on the concept of the Bill Murray film "Groundhog day", which is a very good movie everyone should watch. Gillian Anderson's acting is as good as always and the guest stars where great too. 
Season 6, Episode 14, "Monday," is best remembered as The X-Files' version of Groundhog's Day. The fan-favorite Monster of the Week episode sees Scully and Mulder reliving the same day over and over; however, it always ends with the agents blowing up in a bank robbery gone wrong. At the center of it all is Pam, the girlfriend of the bank robber  
The X-Files was one of the most popular shows of the 1990s. Here are the sci-fi series' most underrated episodes.  a Groundhog Day-type episode where Mulder and Scully are trapped unknowingly  
The X-Files: “Monday” / Millennium: “Matryoshka” More, actually. If you’ve ever seen Groundhog Day (and if you haven’t, you should get on that), you’ll remember that Bill Murray’s  
This is a more "chaos theory" version of the Shadow Play theme (the episode of The Twilight Zone that inspired Monday, Groundhog Day, and episodes of TNG and Supernatural), where little changes are possible that eventually effect the entire system. Mulder is basically the embodiment of chaos, so it's fitting that he is the one to break the cycle. 
Harold Ramis’s Groundhog Day turns 24 this year,  And then there’s the famous X-Files episode “Monday,” co-written by Breaking Bad‘s Vince Gilligan and inspired by The Twilight Zone  
Print the PDF templates on 8.5 x 11 (letter size) printer paper. Cut out the groundhog and glue him to a popsicle stick. Cut along the dotted line on the background page. Insert the groundhog into the hole in the paper. Have fun playing with this simple groundhog craft, popping the groundhog up and down so he can see his shadow (or not)! 
In an episode reminiscent of Groundhog Day, Mulder and Scully become trapped in an endless loop, doomed to repeat the same day over and over until they get it right. 
Arcadia (6x15)-Mulder and Scully undercover. Monday (6x14)-Groundhog Day episode. Clyde Bruckman’s Final Repose (3x4)-needs no summary Humbug (2x20)- possibly the beginning of my sideshow fixation 
Groundhog day has always been a more muted color grading, and its not dramatically different. Audio is also a little better I'd say. Overall: A 5 to 15% upgrade in picture quality makes this disc the definitive release and the best the film has ever looked, but not dramatically so. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Will the groundhog see its shadow? With this adorable groundhog shadow art project, you’ll decide! This craft is perfect for celebrating Groundhog Day with a creative twist, and it’s super easy to make. Using simple materials and a dash of imagination, you’ll create a charming groundhog scene that’s as fun to craft as it is to display. 
Considering Doctor Who is a show that is heavily reliant on the concept of time travel, it should come as no surprise that it has a Groundhog Day episode of its own. In “Heaven Sent,” the Doctor finds himself trapped in a remote castle on Gallifrey, where he’s relentlessly pursued by a terrifying creature known as the Veil, only to be reborn in a glass chamber every time he’s killed. </p>
