        <h2><strong>christmas groundhog day what month is groundhog day in</strong></h2>
        <p>"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:  
It is based on the short story Christmas Every Day by William Dean Howells and takes inspiration from Groundhog Day. Preteen Rowena "Ro" Clybourne (played by Scarlett Estevez) is a high-spirited 12-year-old who is determined to have the best Christmas ever at all costs, in an attempt to help her divorced parents reconcile. 
1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. Bill Murray is hilariously brilliant in what is perhaps his finest role — a local weatherman doomed to relive the same day again and again. 
Groundhog Day is such a great palate cleanser after Christmas because the holiday is already in the rearview mirror in this film. No one’s talking about Christmas when February 2 is the biggest  
Read on to learn about the history and origins of Groundhog day, the day's Christian roots, and how it came to be the holiday it is today.  Feb. 2 marks 40 days after Christmas,  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The surprising history of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil's rise to fame goes back thousands of years.  This feast day, called Candlemas, falls 40 days after Christmas, marking the end of  
This is a modern retelling of Groundhog Day about a tween girl adjusting to her changing family over the holiday season. Meet Rowena, a Chicago girl, who wakes up on Christmas morning time after time (after time) and slowly (ever so slowly) comes to understand its true meaning. 
These days when you say, “Groundhog Day,” most people immediately think of the 1993 movie. Only after that do they remember the February 2 holiday featuring a cowardly rodent. 
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
A group of present-day teenagers are sent back to 1981, and discover a summer camp which is stuck reliving the day a demented killer went on a rampage. [22] Christmas Do-Over: 2006: A father is stuck in a time loop when his son wishes that every day was Christmas day. A remake of Christmas Every Day from an adult perspective. The Girl Who Leapt  
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. 
Recently I am having this deja vu feeling of my life, not in a good way, but feeling a little bit stuck, and then when I woke up this morning (Asia timezone), my gut told me to watch "Groundhog Day". Since I remember I watched a Hallmark movie years ago with similar theme, I went to check and got 2 results after some searching: 
Christina Lauren's fans are sure to love this lighthearted novel, perfect for those who liked Groundhog Day or Life After Life. ” ― Shelf Awareness “Sexy, festive, and heartwarming, In A Holidaze is the perfect book to read as you curl up under a blanket near a fire this holiday season." 
Will the groundhog see its shadow? With this adorable groundhog shadow art project, you’ll decide! This craft is perfect for celebrating Groundhog Day with a creative twist, and it’s super easy to make. Using simple materials and a dash of imagination, you’ll create a charming groundhog scene that’s as fun to craft as it is to display. 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre.
