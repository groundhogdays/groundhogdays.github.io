(at around 59 mins) The scene where Phil picks up the alarm clock and slams it onto the floor didn't go as planned. Bill Murray slammed down the clock, but it barely broke, so the crew bashed it with a hammer to give it the really smashed look.

In groundhog day, I don't think we ever have a reason to believe anyone but Phil is aware of the resets. Everything but Phil's consciousness is restored to exactly how they were when the alarm woke Phil the first time.
