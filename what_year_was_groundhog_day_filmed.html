        <h2><strong>what year was groundhog day filmed what does groundhog day represent</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission. The film was seen as a potential sleeper success. [61] [62] Groundhog Day was one of many family films released that year, including Free Willy, Last Action Hero, and the highly anticipated Jurassic Park, which would go on to become the highest-grossing film to date  
The Groundhog Day Ceremony was recorded on Woodstock Town Square, near the gazebo. The Northen Federal Savings Bank is the Chase Bank at 118 Cass Street. Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is a real-life town, hosting the annual Groundhog Day since the 1800s. The event is attended every year by thousands of visitors from around the world. 
‘Groundhog Day’ was filmed in Illinois, California, and Pennsylvania, specifically in Woodstock, Algonquin, Rockford, Waukegan, Cary, Loves Park, Los Angeles County, Pittsburgh, and Blairsville. As per reports, the principal photography for the Bill Murray starrer commenced in mid-March 1992 and wrapped up after around 86 days or so, in  
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
7: Bill Murray absconded from the site of another project he was filming to attend Groundhog Day festivities in 1992, a year before the film Groundhog Day was released. 8: Punxsutawney Phil, according to legend, is the original groundhog, as his life is extended another seven years every summer and he swigs a gulp of his “groundhog nog” at  
Groundhog Day Locations. This 1993 comedy film is set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, a borough in Jefferson County. But none of the scenes from the movie were filmed there. Instead, the Groundhog Day production took place in different locations around Woodstock, Illinois, approximately 61 miles northwest of Chicago. 
Bill Murray’s vision for the film was in stark contrast to the vision Ramis had in mind. After the film was complete, the bond between Harold Ramis and Bill Murray was shattered, and the two did not speak again for 21 years. And last but not least, the filming locations. Filming Locations: 344 Fremont St, Woodstock, Illinois, USA (Bed

Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
Woodstock, Illinois celebrates Groundhog Day 2025 where Bill Murray filmed 1993 movie. The home of the Groundhog Days movie is celebrating 33 years with its annual celebration. 
Where was Groundhog Day filmed? In real life, Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is known for its annual Groundhog Day celebration and is home to a famous rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, who predicts how many weeks are left of winter based on whether or not he sees his shadow on February 2 each year. 
Each year, the town hosts a Groundhog Days festival, and, with the film celebrating its 32nd anniversary this year, Woodstock is “reveling in the rewind,” as event officials put it. 
Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
The film’s impact on Punxsutawney, Pa.. Believe it or not, Groundhog Day wasn’t even filmed in Punxsutawney or at Gobbler’s Knob (More on that in the “fun facts” below). 
It certainly had a huge impact on the small town though. Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that  
This is the 33rd anniversary of the filming, and Woodstock is filling the celebration with events for everyone. The 2025 schedule begins Jan. 30 and includes groundhog trivia, a Groundhog Day 5K  
While the surreal nature of the story of the 1993 film intrigues many viewers, the recurring visuals of the locations where Phil lives the same day again and again only make one more curious about the actual filming sites of ‘Groundhog Day.’ If you have been wondering the same, allow us to fill you in on all the details! 
Murray was a few years away from making what many consider his best film, “Groundhog Day,” which was filmed in Woodstock and hit theaters in 1993 and remains part of the fabric of that  
Groundhog Day (Pennsylvania German: Grund'sau dåk, Grundsaudaag, Grundsow Dawg, Murmeltiertag; Nova Scotia: Daks Day) [1] [2] [3] is a tradition observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year. </p>
