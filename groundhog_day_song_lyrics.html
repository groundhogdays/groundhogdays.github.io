I’m a little groundhog, it’s my day. Wake and stretch; go out and play. Down in my burrow, down so deep, Time to wake up, from my long winter’s sleep. Grumble, grumble, scratch, scratch, (dramatic action) Grunt, grunt, yawn. I’ll eat my breakfast in your front lawn. I’m a little groundhog, it’s my day. Wake and stretch; go out and play. 
But I'm broke and unemployed Another night staring straight into the void and I just wanna drive away But I don't have a car so I guess I gotta stay And it's easy to say I'm ok Up and down these emotional waves I'm sick and tired of living Groundhog Day Day after day, day after day And I think I'm gonna break Day after day Day after day Day
