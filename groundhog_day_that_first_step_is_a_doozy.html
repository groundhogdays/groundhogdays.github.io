        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) - Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy! 
Consider Romans 11:11 "I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall, did they?"While a stumble is recoverableas Phil eventually realizesa  
Watch out for that first step, it's a doozie. 
Doozy at wordorigins. The word predates the 1920s-era Model J Duesenberg, the phrase may or may not. I think we’re trying to find the phrase “watch out for that xxxxx step” rather than the “doozy.” I can find both “last” step and “first” step used in newspaper stories from the 1930’s. 
1. The movie wasn't filmed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. "Groundhog Day" is set in Punxsutawney, but most of it was filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. 2. That first step is still a doozy. 
“It’s a doozy.” And it certainly is a doozy. Not just the first step. But the second. And many steps after. Phil plunges into a pothole filled with icy water. He eventually learns, finally sidesteps the puddle, but not without getting his leg wet a few times. And that’s part of what Groundhog Day is all about. We’re watching a man

One of the most memorable characters from the movie Groundhog Day is Ned Ryerson, played by Stephen Tobolowsky. With his enthusiastic and persistent personality, Ned Ryerson never fails to bring laughter to the screen. Here are some hilarious quotes from Ned Ryerson: “Watch out for that first step, it’s a doozy!” 
How many warnings has Ned Ryerson, the resident nudnik in “Groundhog Day,” offered us about that first step off the curb? (It’s a doozy.) How many admonitions that “time is a flat circle  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
However, the year after Groundhog Day, Strasser wrote about an eighth-grader named Jake who is forced to relive the first day of schoolFOREVER. (Really, the first day of school isn’t so bad. No homework yet, no tests. Finals would make for a worse fate.) There’s even a Groundhog Day reference, as the kid wakes up having dreamt of a

He re-enters the house to warn the speaker: "Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy." Doozy, of course, abbreviates Duesenberg, whose automobiles were the nec plus ultra of luxury in their day; over time doozy evolved to mean an extreme example of its kind. – 
Send this ecard to warn someone about the first step being a doozy. 
But Groundhog Day is such a clever, wonderful ride that you don't notice the joins. It's rare for a comedy to be funny and profound but also popular. Films such as Groundhog Day and Back to the Future sold a lot of popcorn, but they were insanely smart too. That's very inspiring when you're sitting there trying to write a comedy screenplay.
