        <h2><strong>groundhog day musical plot names for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Synopsis. A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
In spite of his protests, Phil is forced to travel to Punxsutawney, where the townspeople hope that the groundhog sees his shadow on the morrow, signifying an early arrival of spring for the year (“There Will Be Sun”). Phil wakes up the morning of February 2--Groundhog Day--in an even more foul temper than before. 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
Synopsis: Groundhog Day follows Phil Connors, a weatherman, who finds himself stuck living the same day over and over in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. As Phil navigates the repetition of events, he undergoes a transformative journey of self-discovery, learning about love, kindness, and the true meaning of life. 
Synopsis to the Broadway Musical Groundhog Day. Broadway 2017 Groundhog Day the Musical - Synopsis. Act I Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. 
Groundhog Day. He has a camembert addiction. Debbie Johnsonand Fred Kleiser met on Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney four years ago and come back every year. Debbie wants to learn how to sing, and Fred secretly wishes to propose to Debbie, but can’t afford to buy her a diamond. They are big fans of Phil Connors. 
Groundhog Day Synopsis - Broadway musical Phil Connors is a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the isolated small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when he finds himself caught in a time loop, forced to repeat the same day again and againand again. 
Groundhog Day was voted #34 in the American Film Institute’s 100 Years 100 Laughs list, #8 in AFI’s Top 10 for Fantasy Films, and was added to the US National Film Registry in 2006. Rubin worked on the concept of adapting Groundhog Day to the stage for many years before it reached fruition. 
Groundhog Day contains flashing lights, smoke, gun shot effects &amp; some strong language. The story ends happily but has darker phases. The story ends happily but has darker phases. One musical sequence in act 2 satirically portrays the central character attempting suicide four times. 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. 
Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are left on full, jangling boil. 
Groundhog Day on Broadway has received nominations for SEVEN Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Original Score and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical for Andy Karl; FIVE Outer Critics Circle Award nominations; TWO Drama League Award nominations and a Drama Desk Award nomination. 
Groundhog Day, the Olivier Award-winning new musical featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchinand a book by Danny Rubin, and directed by Matthew Warchus, opens tonight, Monday April 17, on  
The musical adaptation of Groundhog Day, which opened at the Old Vic Theatre in London in 2016 and then transferred to Broadway in 2017.With a book written by Danny Rubin (who penned the original film) and songs by Tim Minchin, the musical tells the familiar story of disgruntled weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a "Groundhog Day" Loop where he is forced to relive the titular holiday over and  
What: “Groundhog Day,” the musical When: Friday, Jan. 31-Sunday, Feb. 23. Show times are 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Where  
Seven years after its premiere, the Groundhog Day musical is back at the Old Vic. Andy Karl is still playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors, condemned to relive a single day over and over. And I still love it. 
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  </p>
