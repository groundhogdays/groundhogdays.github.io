When you remember the classic 90s movie Groundhog Day, you might not immediately think of the music as one of its standout features But it does have one special claim to cinematic fame, as home to the only soundtrack theme penned by the gifted comedy writer and director Harold Ramis. 
Today, of all days, Pittsburgh TV weatherman Phil Connors is about to experience a bizarre phenomenon during the town's annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festival. With Murphy's Law in full effect, Phil soon realises he is caught in a strange time loop that forces him to start his day from scratch and relive the same events repeatedly. 
I n the 1993 comedy “Groundhog Day,” disgruntled weatherman Phil Connors finds himself caught in a time loop. He repeats the February holiday for what seems like an eternity — according to one estimate, spending close to 34 years trapped in the same Punxsutawney routine. 
Put on the map by the 1993 Bill Murray film where a TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, forced to report on the annual celebration time and again, Groundhog Day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year at Gobblers Knob. 
It certainly had a huge impact on the small town though. Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day.

Over the years, Phil has made his annual appearance in front of thousands of spectators and media outlets at his home in Gobbler's Knob. Just how has Phil managed to keep working for 138 years? 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film which follows the eccentric weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray. Every day Phil wakes up to find himself living the same day over and over again in a surreal time loop, where he remains trapped in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.  Phil is not a great weatherman. 
Phil (Bill Murray), a weatherman, is out to cover the annual emergence of the groundhog from its hole. He gets caught in a blizzard that he didn't predict and finds himself trapped in a time warp. He is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he gets it right.
