        <p>Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). They hunt evil creatures and other supernatural foes, with the first season focusing on their  
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah

When Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who was looking into a tourist attraction known as "The Mystery Spot" -- where the laws of physics don't apply -- Sam is thrown into a repeating loop, living the same day over and over, and watching Dean die each time in a different way as Sam avoids the method that killed him the last time. 
A Supernatural season 3 episode can explain a plot hole in the season 15 finale. Sam and Dean Winchester have always brought each other back, or at least tried to. It all started with John Winchester when he traded his soul for Dean’s in season 2, “In My Time of Dying.” 
For this episode = Dean dies at least 102 times, but only in the Trickster's reality. For the series so far = At least 236 humans (of which 3 were witches), 17 ghosts, 9 demons, 10 vampires, 6 changelings, 3 gods, 2 shapeshifters, 2 werewolves, 1 djinn, 1 rakshasa, 1 rawhead, 1 shtriga, 1 wendigo, and 1 zombie. 
Long story short, I ended up watching “Mystery Spot” before most other episodes of the show because it happened to be on TV one night and I was fully hooked. The episode, which finds Sam stuck in a Groundhog Day-style time loop that resets after Dean dies, was a brilliant mixture of comedy, angst, and poignancy. By that point in the season

I always love these episodes. The bottle episodes where a character or characters are trapped in a time loop and have to find a way out. I can only think of a couple, and was looking for more. Xfiles: Monday (s6e14) Supernatural: Mystery Spot (s3e11) Star Trek NG: Cause and Effect (s5e18) 
Really interesting take on the Groundhog Day principle, which ties in well with the Supernatural story as you see a change in Sam as he becomes more ruthless, determined and detached from others in trying to change Dean's fate. 
This is the Groundhog Day-like episode, and we all know that Supernatural is great at handling dark comedy. Also, it’s written by new staff writer Jeremy Carver, whose last script was the very

Bill Murray's 1993 classic Groundhog Day is useful shorthand when talking about movies or TV shows that feature time loops, with characters doomed to repeat the same day over and over again until  </p>
