        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Every Feb. 2 millions can't help but wait and see if a groundhog, most specifically Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow or not which in turn determines winter's extension or spring's early arrival. 
February 2nd is Groundhog Day. The first documented American reference to Groundhog Day was found in a diary entry by storekeeper James Morris of Morgantown, Pennsylvania dated February 4, 1841. 
The earliest known American reference to Groundhog Day can be found at the Historical Society of Berks County in Reading, Pa. The reference was made Feb. 4, 1841 in Morgantown, Berks County (Pennsylvania) storekeeper James Morris’ diary:

The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. 
The first official Groundhog Day in the United States was celebrated in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. As a newspaper editor, Clymer Freas declared the local groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, to be America’s only true weather-forecasting groundhog. The event garnered attention, and Phil’s annual prediction became national. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. – Groundhog Day is on Feb. 2, but the yearly tradition of watching a groundhog one day a year is about much more than predicting the timeliness of spring. Punxsutawney Phil emerging from the ground is also about Americans seeing or not seeing the shadow of the oldest known indigenous tribe in the United States. 
Groundhog Day as we recognize it today began to take shape in the early 19th century. Punxsutawney, a small town in Pennsylvania, is credited with establishing the first official Groundhog Day celebration. In 1886, a group of locals, including a newspaper editor named Clymer H. Freas, founded the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day has its roots in ancient midwinter ceremonies. How did the U.S. end up celebrating Groundhog Day in the first place?

But how did this weather tradition begin? The earliest known American reference to Groundhog Day can be found at the “Historical Society of Berks County” in Reading, Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog Day is a quirky tradition celebrated every February 2nd. Ever wondered why we rely on a groundhog to predict the weather? Groundhog Day has deep roots in folklore and history, blending ancient customs with modern fun. This day revolves around a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, who emerges from his burrow to forecast the coming of  
To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently. 
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
Today is Groundhog Day (February 2) which, for anyone living outside the US, means little more than an early nineties Bill Murray film reference. But, amazingly, Groundhog Day is a real tradition  
An early American reference to Groundhog Day can be found at the Historical Society of Berks County in Reading, Pennsylvania. In an entry dated February 4, 1841, Pennsylvania storekeeper James Morris wrote in his diary in Morgantown, Berks County:

Groundhog Day is a philosophical comedy film from 1993.
