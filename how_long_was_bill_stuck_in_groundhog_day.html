        <h2><strong>how long was bill stuck in groundhog day is groundhog day coming to sydney</strong></h2>
        <p>Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
The Murray character was trapped in that one day for just under 34 years. (And before you ask, yes, the dude added leap days into his computations as well.) Advertisement 
Working out how long Bill Murray was stuck in Groundhog Day. To figure it out the movie had to be broken down into three key stages. These stages are the 38 shown in the movie, the 414 days mentioned in the movie (which included card tricks and robbing a bank), and the mammoth 11,931 days he spent learning. 
Groundhog Day has turned 30, but one fan theory claims Bill Murray's character Phil is still stuck in a time loop in Punxsutawney reliving the same day again, and again 
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day." According to their findings, Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a period totaling eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
When you kick back to watch the movie Groundhog Day, one imagines Phil (played by Bill Murray) trapped in a repeating loop for a little over a month. Turns out, it was much, much, much longer than that. Plato had a theory that one’s soul required 10,000 years to realize its full potential and attain complete understanding. 
Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Per IMDB, "On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years." OR "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
Ever since the movie "Groundhog Day" was released in 1993, fans have wondered how long Bill Murray's character was forced to relive February 2nd. 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
How long was Phil Connors stuck in Groundhog Day? Bill Murray's character relives the same day more than 12,000 times. Yahoo UK Staff. Fri, February 2, 2024 at 9:12 AM UTC. 2 min read. 
2 February is Groundhog Day – when, according to Punxsutawney folklore, a groundhog called Punxsutawney Phil predicts the arrival of spring. The tradition spawned the 1993 comedy classic that saw Bill Murray's sardonic TV weatherman Phil Connors stuck in the same day over and over again. 
An arrogant weatherman, Phil Connors (Bill Murray), is stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day until he learns to be kind to others. How long is Phil stuck in the loop? Screen Rant
