This "List" consists of Harry Potter or Naruto Stories based on the idea of GroundHog's Day. Infinitly looping day, week, month or year etc. 
Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter (8) Sherlock Holmes/John Watson (8) Sirius Black/Remus Lupin (6) Include Additional Tags Groundhog Day (1243) Time Loop (599) Angst (254) Temporary Character Death (190) Time Travel (158) Angst with a Happy Ending (158) Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence (156) Hurt/Comfort (98) Alternate Universe (97) Fluff (92) 
The beginning of Harry's day was routine, meet Luna, get breakfast, scare the hell out of Ron and Hermione with his odd behavior. After that, Harry broke routine by going to class. "Today," Snape loomed over the first row. "I am going to attempt to drill into your thick skulls . . ." "Shut up you dirty bag of dragon droppings," Harry called out. 
The next time Dumbledore gave the Groundhog Day potion to Harry, he made sure that Ron did not interfere. Of course, things were thrown into chaos when Luna Lovegood accidentally drank some of the potion, on Harry's 200th day of the cycle, but that's another story. 
Mornings that had once begun with kisses and lovemaking now started with a silent acknowledgement of the dread infiltrating every crevice of their waking lives. The soul-crushing weight of Harry's safety pressing against them both like a leadened shroud. On cue, Harry's cries shattered the precarity of their quietude. 
Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon by willyolioleo. At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. 
Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged â€˜You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.â€™Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU Site : Archive of Our Own | Fandom : Harry Potter - J.

He watched Potter and Weasley walk down the steps with their dates. Weasley went into the hall and left Potter with his date outside. Granger arrived at the top of the steps, at first she glanced around timidly before appearing fully. Draco watched her face as she started descending the stairs, she caught Potterâ€™s eye and gave a small timid  
Wikipedia informs me, at the time of initial posting of this piece here in May of 2019, that originally the back-story to Groundhog Day involved some sort of curse or magic spell being responsible for events; since this piece was first written for and posted on an alternate history site, I substituted the weird bat-things carrying out

A/N: This is inspired by the old film 'Groundhog Day' â€“ if you haven't seen it, a man gets stuck in a time loop, repeating one day over and over. He eventually re-evaluates his life and changes his ways, so he can break the loop he's stuck in. The basic concept is applied here, I have got poor Draco stuck in his time loop. Groundhog Day  
Not really a Groundhog Day story. To me, it is yet another DLP-bait, Harry-Potter-is-Wolverine fic. He drinks, he smokes, he fucks, he takes massive damage but gets better. The usual. It doesn't read like a Harry Potter story, more like the massive genre crossover it all but admits to in the author's initial blurb chapter. 
In early 1993, the Bill Murray masterpiece Groundhog Day came out- the story of a man forced to relive the same day over and over again until he got things right. Unfortunately, for Harry, getting things right was easier said than done. 
She had her eyes on him since first year, much as Draco had. But Draco was realistic and knew that he would be lucky to meet a man, as half as decent, as Potter. Potter was straight, Potter was the saviour, Potter was the exact opposite to Draco in every way. Opposing houses, opposing sides in the war, and even opposing sexuality. 
Yet, Potter wouldn't remember all the hard work and effort Draco had put in. Today he had enough, he waited until Potter once again escaped the common room to hide from Weaslette. Potter was sat in a huge window seat, looking out the window at the sky. Draco stopped in front of him and coughed to make Harry aware that he was there.

Not Harry Potter, the movie Groundhog Day, nor anything else that might pop up in this story. Mine are only the spelling errors. Author's Note: The following is set in sixth year. It is completely Ron/Hermione, if you haven't already guessed. Maybe some H/G later on. I hope it's not too stereotypical. 
Groundhog Day. Daphne was startled awake the next morning by a couple of friends bouncing on her bed. 'What the hell are you doing?' Daphne said to her two friends who had settled cross-legged on the end of her bed, beaming smiles on their faces. 'Good morning to you too, Miss Lucky,' Tracey said. 'Tell us everything,' Millicent said. Daphne  </p>
