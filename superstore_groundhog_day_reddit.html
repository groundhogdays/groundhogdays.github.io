        <p>I just watched the Groundhog episode for the first time. I'm only at 2 minutes so far. I'm seriously disturbed by how hurt the groundhog got, and how real the whole incident looked. It looks like Gary the groundhog actually got seriously hurt with a major injury from Amy putting her hand on him and the cage falling. 
The next day, they say about tate left his credit card so Amy had to pay the whole tab. Tate was supposed to get paid for drug dealing but didn't so he "forgot his card" lol little Easter egg in this episode!!

Glenn: What are you doing here? The doctor said to spend the rest of the day resting. Dina: I'm fine, I've never missed a day of work before, and I'm not about to start because I had a few boba balls shot up my runway. Jonah: The miracle of life. Glenn: Okay, no, I am taking you home. Come on. Dina: I'm not leaving the store. Dina: This is dumb.

Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes.
