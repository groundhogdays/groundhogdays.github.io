        <h2><strong>groundhog day naruto fanfiction groundhog day imdb parents guide</strong></h2>
        <p>"Hey princess," her dad said tiredly. He been busy with Ibiki all day and was definitely ready to hit the sack. But he had delayed teaching Ino this jutsu long enough, and he left on another mission tomorrow. He had to start teaching it to her now. "Hi daddy!" she exclaimed happily. Inoichi's eyes brightened at her warm greeting. 
Groundhog Day. It was the heat of the moment; telling me what your heart meant! Sasuke stretched as he sat up in bed and glanced at his clock. It was Tuesday 10th December and he had a good feeling about that day. He got out of bed and slipped on a thick navy-blue jumper and a pair of dark blue jeans. 
Naruto finds he is flung back in time and must repeat the entire Chunin exam over and over and over, until he gets it right and possibly saves Konoha in the bargain. Naruto - Rated: T - English - Adventure/Humor - Chapters: 77 - Words: 344,950 - Reviews: 19733 - Favs: 11,719 - Follows: 8,957 - Updated: 5/22/2010 - Published: 12/4/2007 - Naruto U. 
“Lair,” Naruto and Sakura chorused. “It hasn’t rained in weeks,” Sasuke muttered. “Anyway, I thought we’d spar today,” Kakashi said brightly. “Sakura, you’ll be with me and Naruto and Sasuke, you two can spar.” Sakura groaned inwardly. Sasuke usually beat her quickly and Naruto went easy on her. 
Groundhog Day Loop: The protagonist repeatedly experiences a short period of time (in the Trope Namer, a single day). Groundhog Peggy Sue : The protagonist repeatedly experiences a long period of time (like a video game's New Game Plus mode). 
Groundhog Day; Drinking; Post-Episode: s08e06 Confessions (9-1-1 TV) Fix-It of Sorts; Summary. When Tommy's alarm goes off the next day, he does not press snooze. He immediately rolls over and picks up his phone. Wednesday. Fuck. He's seen Groundhog Day almost as many times as he's seen Top Gun, he knows how this goes. 
I want a groundhog day like fix that takes an OC / SI / Some Random from the Fourth Great Ninja War. My idea: Jashin has taken one of his many sacrificial souls and thrown him into a repeated cycle of events that he must unfold. The MC will climb from the bottom to the top (somehow). 
A few minutes later, Naruto arrived. He joined their activity. Without opening her eyes Sakura said, “good morning Naruto.” The blonde started and then replied, “good morning Sakura.” After a moment he said, “good morning Sasuke.” Sasuke replied with a hum. 
This is the day Sakura nearly threw away her chance of being Chunin just so Naruto would have another chance to do so. It’s also the day she nearly died protecting Naruto when he was unconscious. It’s the same day Sasuke admitted to seeing Naruto as a rival and wanting to fight him as an equal, the same day he fought to protect Naruto even  
It must be some sentimental day to Haku that went one ear and out the other! Maybe his friends know. Zabuza stood up and ran out the door, his 1/4 Eaten Ham and Cheese Omelette sitting to grow cold, unaware that moon cycles was the only thing his calendar covered and that minor holidays were left off. 
Author's Note: warnings for character death and mentions of suicide.This is a loop story. Chapter 1: Day 1.0. There went her alarm. Sakura Haruno groaned, rolled over, and slammed her hand onto the jangling alarm clock. 
He didn't understand why Iruka always called on Naruto, and didn't just spare the blonde boy the embarrassment. "Naruto," Iruka called, pointing at the boy. Shikamaru sighed, sitting next to Sasuke. "Troublesome." "A genjutsu is a jutsu that puts the victim in an illusion," Naruto said proudly, holding his nose up in the air. 
Author's Note: The idea for a Groundhog Day-style time loop centered on the Chuunin Exam originates with Perfect Lionheart's story "Chuunin Exam Day" (at least, that's the first place I'd ever seen the idea). But as will quickly become apparent, that plot device is about the only thing this story and that one have in common. 
Naruto yelled back up at the window before realizing the number stares he was attracting from his hole in the road. He flashed an award winning smile and quickly dusted himself off before pausing to look at Ino. 
Chapter Eight: Day 1.14. Sakura's alarm clock jangled insistently on the kunoichi's nightstand. Sakura shut it off and stood up, stretching. She took a quick shower, dressed, and pulled her hair back into a tight bun as she hurried down to breakfast. 
@Cosgrove: While I'll agree for the most part about Kakashi and Sasuke, I will totally disagree about Sakura. She's just been let off the hook, and can now attemtpt to make herself 'look good' in front of Sasuke by taking things out on Naruto despite the fact that it was entirely thanks to him that she can now avoid the death trap. 
Sakura said. "I can't believe it. Naruto!" The blonde had just entered the field and Sakura sprinted over to him. "Naruto it's Tuesday!" "Um, yeah," Naruto replied. She threw her arms around him. Naruto blushed. Sasuke walked over, "she's really excited about it being Tuesday for some reason." "Because it's the most amazing day of the week!" 
Warning: story does not actually occur on Groundhog Day or have anything to do with the holiday. This is a Sakura growth story. It is also a loop story that focuses mostly on Sakura. No pairings. Rated for ninja violence and character death. Cross posted on AO3. 
For one whole year, the teachers shall force their students to celebrate every holiday of the year in the quest of life, liberty and the pursuit of youthfullness! 
The special jonin was able to give him several pointers on his leaf floating technique, and after another day of training Naruto went to bed one very confused boy. I I I "Oy, Saku eh, Haruno-san," Naruto called out weakly, giving a half hearted wave to his pink haired teammate as she came skipping up to greet Sasuke. </p>
