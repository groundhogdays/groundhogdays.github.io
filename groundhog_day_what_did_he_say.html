        <p>Will the Groundhog See His Shadow in 2025? According to our weather predictions, February 2, 2025, will bring snow showers and cold weather. We think that when Punxsutawney Phil—that Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Weather Prognosticator Extraordinary— emerges from his burrow (with a little help from his handlers) to make his much-anticipated forecast, he will NOT see his shadow, which  
In his 2003 book Groundhog Day, folklorist Don Yoder traces the roots of Groundhog Day to the same cycle of pre-Christian festivals that gave us Halloween and Mayday, the Library of Congress cites. 
"What this weather did not provide is a shadow or reason to hide," a handler read off the scroll he said Phil had chosen. "Glad tidings on this Groundhog Day, an early spring is on the way  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Phil emerged from his burrow at 7:21 a.m. and he did not see his shadow, predicting an early spring. What did Punxsutawney Phil say?  'Groundhog Day' screenwriter,  
Punxsutawney Phil – the famous groundhog weather watcher – woke up and did not see his shadow Friday morning, calling for an early spring. Each February 2, on Groundhog Day, the members of the  
Since 1993's "Groundhog Day" movie starring Bill Murray, visitPA says more than 30,000 people travel to Punxsutawney each year to see Punxsutawney Phil's prediction. What did Punxsutawney Phil say  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
They say when he does see his shadow, that presages six more weeks of winter. Editor's Note (Feb. 2, 2024, 7:26 a.m.)  Why is Groundhog Day celebrated in Punxsutawney? 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. More: Where to watch Bill Murray's 1993 classic movie 'Groundhog Day' for Groundhog Day. What is  
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
How did Groundhog Day start?  "Today the Germans say the groundhog comes out of his winter quarters," read the diary entry, "and if he sees his shadow he returns in and remains there 40 days." 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
PALM DESERT, Calif. — Not every animal said to portend the start of spring emerges in such predictable fashion. At the Living Desert Zoo and Gardens in California, school children guess each year when Mojave Maxine (not to be confused with Nevada’s Mojave Max) will emerge from brumation — the reptile’s version of hibernation — something that only happens when the weather gets warm  
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
Life &amp; Culture; Is Punxsutawney Phil a fraud? Here’s how he ranks against his Groundhog Day competitors. Published: Jan. 30, 2025, 1:37 p.m. 
The loop broke when it was pointless to continue further: I think this is crucial. Each day before that one had the potential to be different, to be better; but not the one when he says that dialogue - it was already as good as we could hope for. Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. 
I went with ten years because I recalled reading somewhere that Harold Ramis said it was ten years, but he actually said it takes about ten years to get good at something, so it's more like 30 to 40 years. And here's the original breakdown from wolf gnards. So, I should have written that he spent at least 10 years stuck there. My bad. 
Groundhog Day is always on Feb. 2. Essentially, a groundhog is made a weather forecaster. If it gets up in the morning and sees its shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. If no shadow is  </p>
