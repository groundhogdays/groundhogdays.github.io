Mr. Groundhog’s Day. On February second The groundhog looked about The sun was shining brightly But his shadow wasn’t out. Mr. Woolly Bear was watching The groundhog search around “Mr. Groundhog look behind you Your shadow’s on the ground.” “Hooray”, the groundhog shouted “For once we both agree Six more weeks of winter weather 
In June, amid the golden fields, I saw a groundhog lying dead. Dead lay he; my senses shook, And mind outshot our naked frailty. There lowly in the vigorous summer His form began its senseless change, And made my senses waver dim Seeing nature ferocious in him. 
Groundhog Day By Ruth Donnelly There’s a furry little fellow In a burrow on a hill. He’s a most important rodent, But his friends just call him ‘Phil.’ He’s no ordinary groundhog. Do you know what he can do? He prognosticates the weather Using shadows as a clue. If he sees his scary shadow, He will dive back in his lair. 
Groundhog sleeps All winter Snug in his fur, Dreams Green dreams of Grassy shoots; Of nicely newly nibbly Roots - Ah, he starts to Stir. With drowsy Stare Looks from his burrow Out on fields of Snow. 
Whether you’re looking for a poem to share with your friends and family, or just want to enjoy some light-hearted verse about this quirky tradition, there are plenty of options out there. One popular groundhog day poem is “The Groundhog” by Richard Eberhart. This poem captures the anticipation and excitement surrounding Groundhog Day as  
A great memorable quote from the Groundhog Day movie on Quotes.net - Phil: When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. 
Walter Scott — ‘The wretch, concentred all in self,Living, shall forfeit fair renown,And, doubly dying, shall go downTo the vile dust, from whence he  
Groundhog Day 1993 Director: Harold Ramis Stars: Bill Murray , Andie MacDowell , Robin Duke , Chris Elliott , Willie Garson Genre: Comedy , Drama , Fantasy Rating: PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) Runtime: 101 minutes 
The wretch, concentred all in self,Living, shall forfeit fair renown,And, doubly dying, shall go downTo the vile dust, from whence he sprung,Unwept, unhonour 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
Groundhog Day - French Poetry: Phil (Bill Murray) impresses Rita (Andie MacDowell) at the end of a series of deja vu dates by consuming increasing knowledge  
One poem that I absolutely love for teaching point of view around Groundhog Day is Amy Ludwig VanDerwater’s poem, “February 3.” Her poem portrays a unique character point of view and helps students think about how the infamous groundhog feels the other 364 days of the year, when he is not the focus of attention. 
So you might start a poem, not love it all, but just use one word or one image to build a fresh poem. Yesterday, I did this. I wished I had written a Groundhog Day poem for the day itself, but I found a way to still write one from this new perspective. Had I written a groundhog poem in the first place, today's idea may have never come forth. 
A nation warned of aberration may not enjoin its citizens enough to rend recrimination within their dens as groundhogs wait throughout the winter 
Rita: "Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry."Phil: "What a waste of time!" </p>
