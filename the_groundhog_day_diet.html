Countless celebrities swear by the so-called “Groundhog Day diet.” It’s a pretty simple concept: eat the same dish every day. Not necessarily for the same meal each day, let alone for every meal. But the idea is to embrace the predictability and potential nutritional benefits of plugging and playing something over and over again. 
On top of that, they’re believed to predict the weather. Punxsutawney Phil is a groundhog from Pennsylvania who is so famous that he has his own holiday, Groundhog Day. It’s believed that this cute rodent can predict extended winters or early springs based on whether or not he sees his shadow when he comes out on February 2nd, Groundhog Day

Groundhog metabolism responds to the surface temperatures from deep within their hibernation den, and if the temperature warms up enough, they will be forced out of hibernation and into the world in search of food. This commonly happens while there is still snow on the ground, and explains why groundhog day is celebrated in early February. 
The Impact of Groundhog Day Traditions on Public Perception. Groundhog Day is a tradition held on February 2 annually, where the behavior of a groundhog is observed to predict the coming of spring.
