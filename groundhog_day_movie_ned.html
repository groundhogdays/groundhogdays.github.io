I doubt that the producers of the movie ever intended their lighthearted comedy to become a lesson in Buddhist teaching  
In the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character experiences a time loop where he is forced to relive the same day repeatedly. This phenomenon causes him to undergo personal growth and self-reflection as he tries to break free from the cycle by changing his actions and attitudes towards others.
