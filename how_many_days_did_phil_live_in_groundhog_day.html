        <p>Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
One Writer Finally Deciphers The Groundhog Day Timeline. On February 2, 2011, former editor and COO of WhatCulture, Simon Gallagher, wrote a more in-depth article analyzing Groundhog Day’s events and pieced together his own timeline. 
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395 times. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
According to WhatCulture, Phil only spent 33 years and 350 days repeating the same day over and over again, or 12,395 times to be exact. P.S. In case you were wondering, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow earlier today, and so we get an early spring! 
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
So just how much of those 10,000 years did Phil spend trapped in a loop? According to WhatCulture, Phil only spent 33 years and 350 days repeating the same day over and over again, or 12,395 times to be exact. P.S. In case you were wondering, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow earlier today, and so we get an early spring! 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
115 votes, 66 comments. true. It really opens up the question of what happened on days we didn't see. We saw Phil try and kill himself a few times, but what about the days where he killed other people? Where he did illegal and im 
Phil and the town of Punxsutawney were portrayed in the 1993 film “Groundhog Day.” (It was really filmed in Woodstock, Ill.) Phil appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in 1995. (He did not get a  
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
I've several times wondered for how long was Phil Connors stuck in that loop. There are the on-screen shown days which I estimate around 40. But then, Phil learns lot of stuff about the people of the town, he learns French poetry, piano, ice sculpting, etc. But there are also the spoken-about days. 
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had  
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  </p>
