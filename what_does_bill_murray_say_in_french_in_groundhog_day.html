Erin: Well, maybe we can end with I found a translation of what Bill Murray says or tries to say in French (his pronunciation isn’t that good) the day after she’s revealed that she likes 19th century French poetry, and then he does his little quoting of a poem. Wes: Right. It’s not a poem. Erin: It’s not a poem.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day (1993) Bill Murray as Phil.  You're a sucker for French poetry and rhinestones. You're very generous.  Say, I was just talking with Buster Green  
Part of what makes this movie so great is the script and all of these famous Groundhog Day quotes. Bill Murray's Best Groundhog Day Quotes -- #GroundhogDay #BillMurray #GroundhogDayQuotes #MovieQuotes Share on X Say It Again: Bill Murray’s Most Famous Groundhog Day Quotes 
My favourite part: Rita (Andie MacDowell) tells Phil (Bill Murray) that she studied 19th-century French poetry. The first time she says it, he laughs at her -- "Really? What a waste of time." -- and she recoils, not a little disgusted with his philistinism.

A long article in the British newspaper the Independent says “Groundhog Day” is “hailed by religious leaders as the most spiritual film of all time.” The movie is about a guy named Phil, played by Bill Murray, who is living the same day over and over again. 
Bill Murray Learned to Speak French, Play Piano, AND Carve Ice Sculptures! What time does the alarm clock go off in Groundhog Day? The clock seen in the movie is actually a prop clock that was designed to flip back and forth between 5:59 and 6:00. 
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ “Bill Murray was a lot of fun. He was very cordial to everybody in Punxsutawney and he was signing autographs — a very nice man. 
But for the sake of argument, let’s say three years apiece. And he cannot do both at the same time because an ice sculpture is 8 hours of work, and he only has a small window each day to get a piano lesson. Learning French is also subjective. It’s safe to say it would take him, at least, 2 years to learn enough French to read French poetry. 
For Murray, Groundhog Day proved his acting skills could take on broader depth, something he'd further showcase in films like Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Lost in Translation

“People always say, ‘Let’s do Groundhog Day again,'” said Andie MacDowell, Murray’s costar in the film, in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. “First of all, Bill Murray’s  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Bill Murray already loved the Groundhog Day festival before the film was released. He ducked out of filming on Mad Dog And Glory to attend the 1992 festivities, a year before Groundhog Day came  
To celebrate Groundhog Day and the film's 30th anniversary, Andie MacDowell shares amusing behind-the-scenes Bill Murray anecdotes from the comedy classic.  “And on Friday nights he would say  
What does Phil say in French in Groundhog Day? A ceremony still takes place every year. The French poem Phil recites in the German restaurant is quoted from the 1957 Jacques Brel song “La bourrée du célibataire” or “Bachelor’s Dance”. </p>
