        <h2><strong>groundhog day religious connection live groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Slowly a popular winter festival evolved, but one largely shorn of its Christian roots. Today Groundhog Day takes its place as a growing phenomenon in the United States complete with school observances, greeting cards, trinkets and paraphernalia for purchase, and even a federally-sanctioned "official" groundhog in Pennsylvania. 
LOS ANGELES, CA (California Network) -- Is Groundhog Day a Christian holiday? The answer, sort of. There's definitely a Christian connection to the holiday. Groundhog Day is an American holiday celebrated every February 2. Across the country, but primarily in New England, a few groundhogs are awakened early from their hibernation. 
“Groundhog Day has its roots in the ancient Christian tradition of Candlemas Day, when clergy would bless and distribute candles needed for winter. The candles represented how long and cold the winter would be. Germans expanded on this concept by selecting an animal–the hedgehog–as a means of predicting weather. 
PADUCAH, Ky. (BP)–On Feb. 2 many Americans celebrated Groundhog Day, but most of them failed to recognize the connection that the holiday has to the early life of Christ. What is this connection? In Luke 2:22-40 the parents of Jesus took Him to the Temple in Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord and also to give a purification offering of two  
Yes, Groundhog Day really does have a Christian connection! Today, February 2, is not only Groundhog Day, but also the 40th day after Christmas, which is the day that Mary and Joseph presented Jesus at the Temple, in keeping with the teaching in Leviticus. We learn about this in Luke’s Gospel: 
Every year, the world watches as Punxsutawney Phil proclaims a long winter or a newly-arrived spring. If it’s a sunny day and he sees his shadow, bad luck for us; if he doesn’t see his shadow, spring has come. Where did this entertaining annual event start? It actually has its origins in today’s feast of [] 
Groundhog Day’s Christian—and Pre-Christian—Roots It’s not just a strange American holiday, or the inspiration for a great movie. by. Maggie Phillips. February 02, 2022. 
The earliest American reference to weather-prognosticating groundhogs in association with this holiday is a diary entry in February of 1841 which reads, “Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six  
Ever notice that Groundhog day and Candlemas fall on the same day? It’s no coincidence: the weather folklore day has a Catholic origin. Every year on February 2nd, the world awaits the legendary Punxsutawney Phil. If the groundhog sees his shadow, it is taken to mean six more weeks of winter; if he does not, spring will come early. 
Apart from some football games being played later today, what does the date February 2nd bring to mind? Groundhog’s Day, or the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord? (No guilting yourself if you took the non-church answer.) Actually, Groundhog Day and The Presentation of the Lord are related, we’ll get to that in a second. 
The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. 
It's February 2nd, and movie fans prepare themselves for Groundhog Day with one of the most deeply philosophical films ever made. 
WOODSTOCK, Ill. (RNS) — Woodstock Willie, perhaps the second most famous groundhog in the country, saw his shadow Thursday (Feb. 2), predicting another six weeks of winter. 
People hoping for an early spring will be checking to see if the groundhog sees its shadow today. What they may not realize is that Groundhog Day has Christian roots. The tradition can be traced to the Christian holiday of Candlemas Day, when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed, according to Yahoo News. It  
"Groundhog Day is a reminder that even in the midst of the coldest, bleakest times, we can find joy and laughter in the simple things. It‘s a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit." – Dr. Lisa Thompson, psychologist. In many ways, the themes of the "Groundhog Day" movie mirror the enduring appeal of the tradition itself. 
It turns out that the modern Groundhog Day tradition is a tale of adaptation, with its origin in a centuries-old Christian holiday. Candlemas, the Groundhog Day forerunner. Groundhog Day is rooted in the historical Christian tradition of Candlemas, about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. Conventionally, this was  
The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
But this is why Groundhog Day is ultimately not a ‘Christian’ movie. Phil was trapped reliving Groundhog’s Day for eight years, eight months, and 16 days before he learned he was stuck with virtue. But he’ll spend the rest of eternity realizing that’s not enough to save him. 
Groundhog Day, its legacy as an inspirational film remains unimpeachable. “The film has become a curious favorite of religious leaders of many faiths,” noted Alex Kuczynski in 2003, “who all see in . Groundhog Day. a reflection of their own spiritual messages.” 1. When the Museum of Modern Art curated a series about films with 
Fear not; I will help thee. Isaiah 41:13. Sunlight glistens on his whiskers as Mr. Groundhog cautiously pokes his head above his earthy burrow. He eases to his haunches, twitches his fuzzy ears and listens for signs of danger. </p>
