        <p>Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
Review. Groundhog Day the Musical. 5 out of 5 stars. Despite being based on repetition, this musical masterpiece manages to be constantly surprising  Overall, Groundhog Day is a movie to  
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
Broadway Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ The Musical.  Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are  
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
Weatherman Phil Connors is furious at having to travel to Punxsutawney, Philadelphia, to report on the doings of groundhog Phil, whose behaviour on February 2 predicts the weather to come. “There’s nothing more depressing than small town USA/And smaller doesn’t come smaller/Than Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day,” he sings, scornfully. 
'Groundhog Day: The Musical' Review: A Splendid, High-Spirited Retelling Of A Classic By Jack Giroux Aug. 24, 2017 11:30 am EST The Groundhog Day musical is a joyful experience about one huge jerk. 
Reviews 'Groundhog Day' review – this extraordinary musical is a total triumph, again 'Groundhog Day' review – this extraordinary musical is a total triumph, again. Read our five-star review of Groundhog Day, starring Andy Karl, now in performances at the Old Vic through 19 August. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day represents his second foray into creating musical theatre from much-loved stories. His previous attempt, also alongside director Matthew Warchus, was a rollicking take on Roald Dahl  
Groundhog Day, the Olivier Award-winning new musical featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchinand a book by Danny Rubin, and directed by Matthew Warchus, opens tonight, Monday April 17, on  
It’s Phil’s journey more than his destination that makes “Groundhog Day” such joy, as Mr. Karl — previously seen as the punch-drunk title contendah of the “Rocky” musical — gives  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl.

Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin.  Due to huge public demand and rave reviews, the production extended by  
Tim Minchin, with too many credits to mention, perfects the music and lyrics for Groundhog Day. Minchin's score, makes a joyful noise, to be sure, but it is not unalloyed hoopla. As one of the shows recurring lines underscores — for all the toe tapping mania — "there's a sense of sadness" (and, I would argue, of substance). 
Broadway Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ The Musical August Wilson Theater; 1228 seats; $159 top. Opened April 17, 2017. Reviewed April 13. Running time: TWO HOURS, 30 MIN. 
“Groundhog Day: The Musical soars.” TheaterMania. David Gordon says “[‘Groundhog Day’] provides a visual feast, is musically fascinating, and features a truly epic performance from leading man Andy Karl,” “‘Groundhog Day’ is one of the more imaginative musicals of the season. 
If this show doesn’t quite escape the shadow of its source material, it adds dimension and depth to it. Groundhog Day makes perfect sense as a stage musical, a form where actions are repeated  </p>
