        <p>How many Groundhog Days are actually in "Groundhog Day?" By Chris Taylor on February 2, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter According to Whatculture.com , Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
Almost since the film’s release (which happened 10 days after Groundhog Day), it has obsessed fans and dogged the film’s cast and crew. Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil  
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
Some of the days of Phil's journey are shown in the film, including the Groundhog Day, the day he robs the bank, and the many days it takes for him to take Nancy on the perfect date. There are 38

In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days.

Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder.

Of course, that number seems much higher than expected, seeing as the day shown on screen was 38 days, and that Connors “spent 11,931 days learning” in the entire process — which includes  </p>
