But musicals based on films seem like a reversal of  
It’s Groundhog Day. . . Again! The iconic film has been transformed into a stage musical by Danny Rubin and Tim Minchin, and it’s just fantastic. Leading characters Phil Connors and Rita Hanson are in the incredibly capable hands of Andy Karl and Elise McCann respectively – two actors who shared divine chemistry on stage. 
Groundhog Day the Musical currently playing at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre delivers an outstanding and captivating performance that leaves the audience thoroughly entertained. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the beloved film seamlessly blends humor, heart, and catchy tunes to create an unforgettable experience.

In 2017 the show was nominated for 8 Olivier awards and went on to win Best New Musical and Best Actor in Musical for the shows lead Andy Karl. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me.

Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, the production will play an exclusive 13-week season in Melbourne with sold out preview performances from Wednesday 24  
Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
Groundhog Day, the Olivier Award-winning new musical featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchinand a book by Danny Rubin, and directed by Matthew Warchus, opens tonight, Monday April 17, on  
What happened to the national tour of Groundhog Day the Musical? After a successful Broadway run, Groundhog Day was slated to begin an 18-month national tour in 2018. So what happened? According to Playbill, the tour was unceremoniously canceled in January 2018. Composer and lyricist Tim Minchin weighed in, saying “Sadly (despicably) there  
Groundhog Day the Musical has ended it’s 13-week season at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Phil Connors, a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Reuniting many of the high wattage talents behind Matilda, new musical Groundhog Day is a slickly produced, crowd-pleasing show in the best Broadway tradition. Multi-talented Australian writer/performer Tim Minchin unveiled his seemingly instant talent for music theatre composition with the instantly hummable, sneakily subversive music and lyrics for Matilda.
