        <p>So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
Groundhog Day infamously sticks Bill Murray in a time loop. It's clear he was there for a long time, but exactly how long?  Danny Rubin's Original 'Groundhog Day' Script Featured a 10,000 Year  
Every year on Groundhog Day, people across the nation check the news to see whether Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow (six more weeks of winter) or not (spring is on its way). Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time  
Ironically, the 10,000-hour skill-learning estimate — which was only ever supposed to be an average — comes from a paper published the same year as Groundhog Day, 1993. 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter According to Whatculture.com , Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. 
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
As per the lore, it is the same Phil—who used to just be called “Br’er Groundhog” or “The Punxsutawney Groundhog” until 1961—who has been delivering weather pronouncements since 1887  
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission. The film was seen as a potential sleeper success. [61] [62] Groundhog Day was one of many family films released that year, including Free Willy, Last Action Hero, and the highly anticipated Jurassic Park, which would go on to become the highest-grossing film to date  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18] Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years.[9] 
Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
It certainly had a huge impact on the small town though. Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that
