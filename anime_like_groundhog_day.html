Time travel is pretty common in fiction but I've noticed Groundhog day effect specifically is overly common in anime compared to other modern tv shows now. Groundhog day effect for those who don't know is where a character relives the same day or experience constantly and has to do something to break it. Examples in modern anime are Higurashi, Madoka, Steins Gate, Haruhi (endless eight

I watched this anime TV series probably 10 years ago and cannot remember the name of it. The plot focused on a large mansion with a large cast of characters. A group of people were invited to this mansion, I believe it was isolated on an island.
