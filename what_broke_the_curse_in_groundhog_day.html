        <p>It is also worth noting that in the earlier draft, the original spell kept Phil in the loop for 10,000 years(ish) and that it was Rita's kiss that finally broke the curse; Phil : You want to know what's really amazing? I've been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. I dream of you every night of my life. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while trapped in this time loop. 
Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, has become a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences to this day. The movie follows the story of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, a cynical weatherman who finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. 
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
Here, producer Trevor Albert and screenwriter Danny Rubin, recall the “curse” that nearly ruined the 1993 Bill Murray classic. Groundhog Day tells the story of disillusioned TV weatherman Phil, who, having travelled to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day event, finds himself reliving the same day over and over  
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
‘Groundhog Day’: How a ‘Gypsy Curse’ Almost Ruined the Movie “They wanted some tangible event to occur in the first act that shows someone has put a spell on him,” producer Trevor  
GROUNDHOG DAY never explained why Bill Murray's Phil was trapped in time or what broke the spell, but the original script reveals everything.  Phil's ex-girlfriend, puts a curse on him  
Groundhog Day Ending Explained Phil Connors learns to use his time to better himself and help others, ultimately breaking the Groundhog Day time loop. The number of times Phil lives through the time loop is not explicitly given, but it is implied to be longer than what is shown on screen. 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. Phil lived his life constantly pushing others away, trying to be aloof, above, and fake. He made himself miserable this way, crafting himself a living hell that got worse every day. 
He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
The curse part is believable, but not the bit about it being passed from Ned to Phil. Ned only makes the big insurance sale after Phil is dozens of days into the curse. If Ned would need to have a perfect day to break the curse and pass it on to Phil, Phil would have to buy the insurance on the very first day. He doesnt. 
The movie is one giant metaphor for ennui and depression. What broke him out was a multi-step process: he improved himself by getting hobbies so he had something that made him feel like he had something of value to add to his self-worth, he got involved in peoples' lives so he felt like he had people that appreciated him and he also felt like he was doing good for them as well. 
Fans took to the official Curse of Oak Island Facebook page to criticize the lack of excitement, with one fan declaring that the series has become the movie Groundhog Day. The Curse of Oak Island  
In the version that made it to theaters, Phil is forced to relive the same day — Groundhog Day — over on a seemingly endless loop, waking up each morning (and even after several suicide attempts) in his bedroom at a bed-and-breakfast in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. After being stuck in the time loop for decades, Phil learns he has fallen in  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
One of the most interesting theories about Groundhog Day actually repaints the movie's ending as far less happy than it otherwise seems. Harold Ramis' 1993 comedy classic Groundhog Day popularized a strangely specific and interesting concept: the use of a time loop as the basis for a romantic comedy. </p>
