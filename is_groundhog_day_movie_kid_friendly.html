        <p>This is one of Murray's most iconic roles. He shines in Groundhog Day, a mostly good-natured comedy that delivers lots of laughs and honest sentiment. Funny and sweet, the film has the right blend of comedy and romance. Although Phil isn't a particularly admirable character, the movie manages to make us care about him.

This movie was good overall. My fav movie Christmas Again starring Scarlet Estevez (also in Ultra Violet) was based on this. This movie's a little long - though there are plenty of funny scenes.

Although GROUNDHOG DAY emphasizes that man desires not to be accountable for his deeds, it falsely implies that man can save himself from his sinful propensities. Even so, the film is humorous, lighthearted and fun though somewhat redundant. Thus, a discerning viewer will come out ahead as he learns “There is nothing new under the sun.” 
For a 90's PG movie the language is exceptionally mild and soft. The comedic suicide scenes are meant to prove a lesson to the main character. They are comedic and exaggerated and actually have an anti-suicide message in that the main character has to re-live Groundhog Day until he becomes a nicer, more decent person.

The movie could still work if she were married with kids, just make Phil’s love interest Chris Elliot- but he would need to adopt the antagonistic viewpoint of Rita, still, and be disgusted by Phil’s self interest and self imposed isolation due to his arrogance and disdain for those he views as beneath him which is everyone.
