        <p>Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
Supernatural's "Groundhog Day" Can Explain Why Sam Never Brought Dean Back When Dean died at the end of the series, Sam didn’t try to bring him back, which was uncharacteristic of the brothers, but there’s an explanation for this in Supernatural season 3, “Mystery Spot.” 
Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). They hunt evil creatures and other supernatural foes, with the first season focusing on their

In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah  
When Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who was looking into a tourist attraction known as "The Mystery Spot" -- where the laws of physics don't apply -- Sam is thrown into a repeating loop, living the same day over and over, and watching Dean die each time in a different way as Sam avoids the method that killed him the last time. 
Shout-Out: To The X-Files, Groundhog Day, and "Dingoes ate my baby." Squashed Flat: How Dean dies in one of the scenarios, courtesy of a hutch dropped by a pair of handymen. The Stoic: Sam becomes this after Dean dies. Suspiciously Apropos Music: On the second Wednesday, Sam wakes up to Huey Lewis and the News' "Back in Time". 
Really interesting take on the Groundhog Day principle, which ties in well with the Supernatural story as you see a change in Sam as he becomes more ruthless, determined and detached from others in trying to change Dean's fate.

A Supernatural season 3 episode can explain a plot hole in the season 15 finale. Sam and Dean Winchester have always brought each other back, or at least tried to. It all started with John Winchester when he traded his soul for Dean’s in season 2, “In My Time of Dying.” 
Supernatural: "Mystery Spot" Review Dean dies. And dies again.  References to Groundhog Day are everywhere, and the episode begins by setting up the various things that will be repeated as Sam

With a show like Supernatural - which reveled in pushing the envelope with odd and often meta episodes - there are more than just a couple.

The season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" saw an interesting take on a premise similar to Groundhog Day, in which Sam is forced to relive the same day over and over again. While this would be a frustrating experience for anyone, it's even worse for the younger Winchester, who is also grieving one of Dean's many deaths in Supernatural. 
Supernatural has numerous episodes that take place in alternate universes, and one of them sees Sam and Dean Winchester existing in the same one as Batman.Although Supernatural has its share of serious episodes, the CW series makes sure to lighten the mood throughout its 15-season run. </p>
