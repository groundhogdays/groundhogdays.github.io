        <h2><strong>is groundhog day a christmas movie how do they pick a new groundhog for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is such a great palate cleanser after Christmas because the holiday is already in the rearview mirror in this film. No one’s talking about Christmas when February 2 is the biggest  
"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:  
Some dabble with the idea of goodwill toward men, others not at all, but every year you’ll likely see at least a few in the post-Christmas day TV listings. Santa won’t be climbing down any chimneys here (well, not without swearing). 1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. 
Without a doubt, Groundhog Day is the superior movie when comparing it to Scrooged. The 1993 film is more unique and shows off the actor's dramatic talents while including his comedic chops. Groundhog Day is the perfect balance of drama and comedy and is regarded as one of Murray's best projects (and one of the best movies of the 1990s). 
DETROW: I love "Groundhog Day" as a holiday and a movie, but I think I'm with you on everything else you said this segment. RIVERS: Like I said, it's still Christmas movie. It's just second-tier  
This ABC family Christmas movie is better than some of the recent Hallmark holiday movies. The writing is sharper and the cast is likable - more A list for TV than usual. The Groundhog Day formula has been used in TV movies sometimes unsuccessfully, but here they got the right elements of Groundhog. 
Yes, Groundhog Day is a Christmas movie. Kind of. On its surface, Groundhog Day seems like a quaint mid-Atlantic American folk custom, a subject that everyone in the country inexplicably must  
Watching Groundhog Day has become an annual tradition almost akin to breaking out your favorite Christmas movies but what makes the Bill Murray comedy a movie you can happily watch again, and  
The best time-loop movies and shows to watch this Groundhog Day.  In 1996's ABC Family film "Christmas Every Day," based on the 1892 short story of the same name, Erik von Detten stars as Billy  
Groundhog Day falls on a Sunday this year, which makes for a perfect day to relax with loved ones and put on a nostalgic movie: "Groundhog Day", starring Bill Murray. "Groundhog Day" begs the  
Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
It is based on the short story Christmas Every Day by William Dean Howells and takes inspiration from Groundhog Day. Preteen Rowena "Ro" Clybourne (played by Scarlett Estevez) is a high-spirited 12-year-old who is determined to have the best Christmas ever at all costs, in an attempt to help her divorced parents reconcile. 
Here are the best movies like Groundhog Day that are actually good and bring something new to the time loop movie subgenre. 15. Doctor Strange (2016) 
This movie is generally seen as the quintessential time-loop movie by many with its name being synonymous with the genre as a whole. [13] [14] [15] Christmas Every Day: 1996: An American television movie based on William Dean Howells's 1892 short story "Christmas Every Day". A selfish teenager is forced to relive the same Christmas every day  
Christmas Do-Over is a 2006 Christmas television film starring Jay Mohr and Daphne Zuniga. [2] It premiered on ABC Family in 2006 on their 25 Days of Christmas programming block. It is a remake of a previous 1996 television film, Christmas Every Day , but with an adult as the protagonist. 
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
I think "Groundhog Day" is the best movie ever made. The story of a cursed man gaining redemption is my favorite. The 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is like classic literature. 
A Year from Now: Directed by Ricky Kennedy. With Trey Cartwright, Stef Cruz, Thomas Elam, Rosa Galarza-Mireles. In a twist on "A Christmas Carol" and "Groundhog Day" a woman experiences seven years of her future over the course of one week. 
Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas.
