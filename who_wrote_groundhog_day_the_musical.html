        <h2><strong>who wrote groundhog day the musical groundhog day hats</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin.  [22] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaptation,  
He played Phil in the original London production, for which he won the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, reprising his role in the Broadway production where he was Tony Nominated for Best Actor in a Musical, and he played Phil again in London for Groundhog Day’s record-breaking return season at the Old Vic in 2023. 
He worked on the stage musical adaptation of Groundhog Day, writing the music and lyrics, with Danny Rubin (who wrote the original screenplay) writing the book and Matthew Warchus directing. Following its hugely successful and acclaimed limited run at The Old Vic, London, in the summer of 2016, the show opened at the August Wilson Theatre on  
He wrote the original story, and then co-wrote with Harold Ramis the screenplay for the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day, for which the two received a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. The stage musical Groundhog Day based on the film premiered in 2016 which won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 2017. 
Synopsis. A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
The team of Minchin and Director Matthew Warchus have of course produced a highly successful musical before, with the outstanding Matilda, and they were joined by Danny Rubin, the original writer of the Groundhog Day movie who wrote the book for Groundhog Day: The Musical. 
The Creators of the Hit Groundhog Day Musical on How They Freed the Show From Creative Limbo. By Ellin Stein. April 17, 2017 7:34 AM. Danny Rubin and Tim Minchin,  
Groundhog Day is a comedy musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and book by Danny Rubin. It is based on the 1993 film of the same name and follows Phil Connors, a weatherman who is sent to cover the Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, before he is caught in a time loop and is forced to relive the same day over and over. It made its world premiere at The Old Vic in London  
It’s a comedic philosophy perfectly suited for Groundhog Day and the show’s cynical newsman protagonist Phil Connors (played by Andy Karl), and Minchin’s canny adaptation of the classic 1993  
Minchin also wrote the music for the stage adaption of Roald Dahl's Matilda.  The concept of Groundhog Day as a musical had been floated since the film was released in 1993. There had been  
When Every Day Is ‘Groundhog Day’. Danny Rubin wrote the beloved movie and, 24 years later, the musical. In between, he lived it. 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Look up Tim Minchin, the guy who wrote the music to Groundhog Day and Matilda. His music is incredible and he puts on a great live show. Most of his stuff are kind of South Park style humor, smart but crass, so it's not as clean as his Broadway work but still really good. White Wine in the Sun is my absolute favorite Christmas song (it's clean) 
H ere’s something that hasn’t already happened: the classic 1993 movie Groundhog Day is on its way to becoming a stage musical.. Tim Minchin, the Australian musician who recently wrote the  
Andy Karl reprises the role of Phil Connors for Groundhog Day in 2023. The Broadway actor first played the role in 2016, and again for the Broadway transfer, picking up an Olivier Award and a Tony nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Who wrote the Groundhog Day musical? Danny Rubin wrote the Groundhog Day musical. 
The famous 1990s movie Groundhog Day that starred Bill Murray as weatherman Phil Connors who became trapped in the same day over and over, has been made into a musical thanks to the creative brilliance of Australian composer, actor and comedian Tim Minchin, alongside the original writer of the screenplay Jewish American Danny Rubin, and English theatre director Matthew Warchus. 
On paper, the happy new musical “Groundhog Day,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Old Vic Theater here,  (who wrote the “Groundhog Day” screenplay with Harold Ramis)  
Tim Minchin, who wrote the music &amp; lyrics for Groundhog Day said: ‘I am hugely proud of our Groundhog Day. It has everything I want in a musical: it’s funny, heart-warming, multi-layered and theatrically intricate, tackling big ideas whilst still being wildly entertaining. 
In fact Danny Rubin who wrote the film screenplay has written this musical’s book . So, once again, a cynical, egocentric TV weatherman Phil Connors is fated to repeat the same day until he redeems himself. The day in question is Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, an annual event when a large rodent predicts the end of winter. </p>
