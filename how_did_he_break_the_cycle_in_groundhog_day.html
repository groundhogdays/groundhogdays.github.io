        <p>PHIL : As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.-25- He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then he closes his eyes and quickly  
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
He used his newfound abilities to goof off, to pull of tricks, to be higher than others, to try to get what he wanted by placing himself above them. Each time, it brought him only misery, and repeated suicide attempts. Then, he had a break and began to be reborn. At first, he worked to better himself. 
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while trapped in this time loop. 
Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, has become a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences to this day. The movie follows the story of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, a cynical weatherman who finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. 
However, when he wakes up at 6 am on February 2nd, Rita is gone, and Groundhog Day starts all over again. Phil decides to be kind this time and brings coffee for his colleagues. He starts reading books at a café, learns to play the piano, learns ice sculpting, and even hugs Ned for so long that Ned leaves immediately without saying much. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Responsible for popularising a unique genre, Groundhog Day stars Murray as Phil Connors – an insufferable, cynical TV weather reporter who travels to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover an annual spectacle. However, he finds himself trapped in a seemingly endless time loop where he is forced to live the same day over and over again. 
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
However, he surprises them on the way by announcing that he’s leaving the news channel, making this their final Groundhog Day together. They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. 
Its not entirely clear. The last time Phil tries to save the hobo is Day 37 (2nd last of the on-screen days) and its left ambiguous. I think part of what Phil needs to learn to break out of the cycle is that he can't fix/solve everything. 
I remember at one point he stays up with Andie McDowall all night to see what would happen, but then he falls asleep and wakes up as ever. So, presumably once he gets a handle on the cycle he could purposefully work towards a 1:1 ratio on subjective hours vs. subsequent sunrises. 
However, his attempts to seduce his producer, Rita, are met with repeated failures. He begins to tire of, and then dread, his existence, starting the day by smashing the alarm clock and professing the inanity of Groundhog Day as a holiday in his newscast. In a vain attempt to break the cycle, he kidnaps Phil the Groundhog. 
Phil believes that he's destined for far greater things in life than local television, so he resents the seemingly menial task of reporting on the annual Groundhog Day celebration in small-town  
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Feeling desperate, Connors eventually tries to break the cycle by driving his car over a cliff, but he still wakes up in bed the next morning. He tries running in front of a bus, but still Groundhog Day continues. In real terms, this is a serious reaction to office burnout. 
He does none of that stuff on his final day. He really doesn’t pursue her at all until she wins the auction at the end. And he uses no trickery at that point. The whole point of the movie is to show that he was self centered, and didn’t break the cycle until he dedicated a day to helping others. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18] Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years.[9] 
From IMDB: . On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. </p>
