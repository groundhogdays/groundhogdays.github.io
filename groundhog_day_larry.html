There's something familiar about Larry the camera guy in Groundhog Day — y'know, beside the fact that you see him do and say the same things on repeat. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
With the big day (February 2nd) nearly upon us, I thought I would use the opportunity to examine the Small Moment that really stood out to me on a recent revisit of Groundhog Day. It is the moment that, for me, answers the question of what the film is about: what its protagonist really learns, and what we as viewers can learn from it.

Feb 3 Larry has a memory only of the last loop of Groundhog Day, and also a memory of Feb 1. Thus the Larry of the last Groundhog Day is in memory continuity with Larry before and after that day, and so these Larrys are memory-theory identical. The Larrys of all the other Days are left out in the cold, identity-wise.

Starring Bill Murray as a grouchy, smug Pittsburgh weatherman who longs for a major-market job, annoyed that he has to truck on over to Punxsutawney to attend their lame Groundhog Day ceremony once again, the film also featured Andie MacDowell as his lighthearted producer Rita and Chris Elliott as the vaguely creepy cameraman Larry. 
Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day. I'll be in Punxsutawney for our country's oldest groundhog festival. According to the legend, tomorrow, February 2nd </p>
