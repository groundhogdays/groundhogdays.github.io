The Day Before Groundhog's Day is a children's picture book written by Natasha Wing and illustrated by Amy Wummer. It is about a small town getting ready for Groundhog's Day as the results it may bring with its prediction. As today is the day before Groundhog's Day (1 February), I thought it would be apropos to read this book.
