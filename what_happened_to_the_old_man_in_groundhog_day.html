        <h2><strong>what happened to the old man in groundhog day groundhog day mbti</strong></h2>
        <p>The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre,  he repeatedly tries and fails to save the life of the old man he had ignored until recently. 
The old homeless man is in poor health, so Phil takes him to the hospital. Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita. 
The first time the old man dies (that Phil is aware of) the nurse tells Phil "He was just old. It was his time. sometimes people die." To which Phil responses "Not today." The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

I do not think that is his biological father, the movie shows over time, how to actually be happy. By taking care of others, Phil becomes truly happy. He does everything he can to help that old man. He does everything he can to show that man some kindness. For no other reason than he doesn't want someone to die on the one day he is trapped in. 
Groundhog Day is observed on February 2, according to the local legend, a day when the groundhog comes out of hibernation, and the locals determine the season change following this event. “ [I]f the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow, we’ve got six more weeks of winter to look forward to,” Connors explains. 
How long was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Well, there are 38 days actually shown on screen, as well as 414 days mentioned in the film and a huge 11,931 days which Phil spends learning a host of new talents and interests – based on the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in any given subject. 
At first Phil ignores the old man. Later Phil gives him money and during another Groundhog Day Phil takes him to the hospital. On that day, Phil is obviously emotionally committed to the old man, demanding to see the chart and refusing to accept the nurse’s evaluation of the situation. Then Phil tries to feed the old man and struggles to  
Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here. Celebrated at the beginning of February, the day was called Imbolc —a term from Old Irish that is most often translated as “in the belly”—a reference to the soon  
To me, every day of this pandemic has felt likeGroundhog Day. I get up, I write some articles, I work on my script, I wander my neighborhood, and I go to bed doing the same thing again and again and again. Still, it's hard to think about a movie as culturally significant as Groundhog Day. It created a whole genre of comedy where people relive  
Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual. Even though Phil Connors’ life resets every February 2 at 6:00 a.m., the movie also shows that for each Groundhog Day he experiences, the world still continues on for  
Still, it’s perfectly sensible to wonder what happened to Phil Connors after his years of endless Groundhog Days. Phil experienced thousands of February 2nds, learned to be a better man, then  
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
It's not just what happened to the hero in the past and what he comes upon in the day that makes him who he is, it's who he decides he is, and the actions that arise from that decision. The reason we cheer for Phil, the hero, is because the 'hero's quest' he is called to - is called to by himself - is to become a better person, and taking  
In the original pitch of that movie to producers Ramis says that Phil lived the same day for 10,000 years. This kinda freaked them out. In the end they left it ambiguous saying that it was how ever long it takes to learn to play the piano.
