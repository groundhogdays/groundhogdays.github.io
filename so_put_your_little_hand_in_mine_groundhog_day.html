They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow Well I don't know if all that's true 'Cause you got me, and baby I got you Babe I got you babe I got you babe They say our love won't pay the rent Before it's earned, our money's all been spent I guess that's so, we don't have a plot But at least I'm sure of all the things

"Then put your little hand in mine. There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb. Babe. I got you babe." Happy Groundhog Day, y'all! In honor of the day when a large rodent tells us how much  
"It's Gonna Rain" never made Billboard's Hot Top 100 chart; but on the day the movie open the duo's "I Got You Babe" was in its third and final week at #1 on the Top 100 chart * The movie was directed by Maury Dexter, and between 1979 and 1983 he directed 21 episodes of the NBC-TV weekly-family series 'Little House on the Prairie'. 
A well-loved 1993 film that massively popularised the time loop trope. With Bill Murray at his deadpan best and a much lauded script, the film is considered a modern classic. Phil Connors, an arrogant and smarmy weatherman for a Pittsburgh local news station, his new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to film the Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Groundhog Day (1993) clip with quote Now put your little hand in mine, There ain't no hill or mountain we cant climb Yarn is the best search for video clips by quote. Find the exact moment in a TV show, movie, or music video you want to share. Easily move forward or backward to get to the perfect clip. 
On Feb. 2, Bill Murray mysteriously lived the same day over and over again in the 1993 classic 'Groundhog Day'. "Then put your little hand in mine" On Feb. 2  
"Then put your little hand in mine" As I’ve already covered Groundhog Day on 4K in addition to our 15th Anniversary Blu-ray review, I’ll refer you over to those momentarily. For a brief bit, I just wanted to reiterate how fun it is to have a seasonal favorite film that’s so specifically holiday appropriate you can only watch it within

Then put your little hand in mine Groundhog Day is a well-loved 1993 film that massively popularized the time loop trope. With Bill Murray at his deadpan best and a much lauded script, the film is considered a modern classic. 
However, it isn't until after they key change and into the third verse that we hear the lines familiar to Groundhog Day viewers: "Then put your little hand in mine / There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb." I find it quite interesting that each repetition of February 2 opens at this point in the song and with this line. 
Then comes emptiness. The void. Solitude. This is Phil’s nadir. This is the endless winter of life in the groundhog’s shadow. Repeated suicide attempts are to no avail – he just twangs right back to that soul-destroying 6:00am Sonny &amp; Cher wake-up call. “Well put your little hand in mine” 
Put Your Little Hand In Mine is a collaborative, GM-less time-loop RPG for three players, inspired by stories like Groundhog Day, Palm Springs, and Russian Doll.You will work together to tell the story of someone who is about to live the strangest day of their life – and then live it again, and again, and again. </p>
