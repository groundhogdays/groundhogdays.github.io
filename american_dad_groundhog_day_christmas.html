Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, and Happy Death Day are completely different films and genres, but they all boil down to the same time loop structure. There are just as many television shows that have used time loops for creative fuel and in that sense, American Dad’s “Yule. Tide. Repeat” isn’t breaking any new ground, but it’s one
