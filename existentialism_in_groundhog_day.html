The movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray, might not strike you as a deep source of ethical instruction, but Joseph Kupfer [1] plumbs its storyline to reveal some delightful ethical insights. He notes that the movie starts with Nietzsche’s idea of the eternal return [2] as a prompt about reflecting on our life and whether it is good  
In his book, How to Write Groundhog Day (2012), screenwriter Danny Rubin tells us, “The first note [after the film premiered] I remember came from a monk in Germany.
