        <p>The short answer is, it depends. Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd, is a unique holiday that is usually not observed as a federal or state holiday. This means that schools and businesses usually operate as usual. However, some schools and institutions may choose to celebrate Groundhog Day with special activities or events. 
It’s 54 pages and perfect for ages Pre-K-2. You might plan to finish it by the 100th day and compare the character’s accomplishments to the class’s. If you prefer, read The Night Before the 100th Day of School about one boy’s struggle to find 100 of anything to bring to class for the 100th Day project.

In Nova Scotia, Groundhog Day is called Daks Day. This comes from the word “dachs” which is German for badger. While Germans don’t celebrate Groundhog Day, they do celebrate a holiday they call Dachstag on February 2. The history of Groundhog Day goes back hundreds of years to an old European tradition that involved watching for animals  
A perfect Groundhog Day activity for the pre-school or kindergarten set is to learn about shadows with some shadow drawing!

Your young learners may not know what a groundhog is, let alone why we have a day to celebrate it each year. They might not understand why thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on a cold morning every February to watch a man in a tuxedo hold a groundhog—while many more watch the ceremony live on television.

There are some really great groundhog themed read alouds for your class to enjoy. I think my favorite is Go to Sleep Groundhog by Judy Cox. I also really love using Gail Gibbons' Groundhog Day.
