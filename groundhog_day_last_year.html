        <h2><strong>groundhog day last year funny groundhog day gifts</strong></h2>
        <p>What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. More: Where to watch Bill Murray's 1993 classic movie 'Groundhog Day' for Groundhog Day. What is  
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
However, last year did not fall in line with the norm. Phil has now seen his shadow 107 times, with no shadow 21 times (10 years of data are missing),  Here's when Groundhog Day began:  
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
Groundhog Day, celebrated every year on February 2, is an unusual holiday that stretches back hundreds of years back to European traditions and even ancient times. How is Groundhog Day Celebrated? Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of  
The Farmers' Almanac and Punxsutawney Phil didn't necessarily agree last year. According to The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club , Phil did not see his shadow in 2024, which called for an early spring. 
In the Fall of 2016, The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club worked with Discovery Studios and Animal planet to create a one hour documentary called: A Groundhog Day Story: The Tale of a Marmot, His Shadow, and the People Who Protect Him. This special aired on Groundhog Day, February 2nd 2017 on the Animal Planet network! 
The groundhog — arguably the most famous member of his species and the most recognizable of all the country's animal prognosticators — did what he has done for the last 138 years: search for a  
According to the data, Phil got it right last year in 2024, calling for an early spring. But over the last 10 years, the groundhog has been correct only two other times: 2020 and 2015, resulting in an accuracy rate of 30%. In fairness to Phil, climatology isn't for the faint of heart. 
Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil pictured as he makes his prediction on how long winter will last during the Groundhog Day Festivities, at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on Feb. 2, 2024  
The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication have been meticulously kept. 
PETA has previously called for Phil’s retirement and offered multiple alternatives for Groundhog’s Day, including a giant gold coin last year. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club did not  
Annually, Groundhog Day falls on Feb. 2. Here's the tradition behind the holiday and why PETA wants to change it.  Last year, PETA offered to toss the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club a giant coin  
However, last year did not fall in line with the norm. Phil has now seen his shadow 107 times, with no shadow 21 times (10 years of data are missing),  Here's when Groundhog Day began:  
In 2023, Phil forecast a "long winter" when he saw his shadow and predicted an additional six weeks of wintry temperatures. In fact, the contiguous United States saw above average temperatures in February and slightly below average temperatures in March of last year. Phil was 50/50 on his forecast. 
On Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, Connecticut's Chuckles XI will deliver his first prognostication since his "arrest" by Guilford police last year. 
Every February 2, on Groundhog Day, Willie takes part in the local Wiarton Willie Festival. His role is to predict whether there will be an early spring. Although the original Wiarton Willie died in 1999, the Wiarton groundhog day celebrations continue each year with the original Willie's successors, referred to as "Wee Willie." 
Punxsutawney Phil will predict if winter will last or spring will arrive early during the annual festivities on Feb. 2. Getty Images. The group argued in the Jan. 21 letter to Tom Dunkel, president of the Pennsylvania-based club, that the 138-year-old tradition should be scrapped, noting that Phil’s weather duties are “no piece of cake for him.” 
Phil's predictions of years past. Phil's first official shadow sighting came in 1887, followed by several years of no official recordings. His longest stretch of seeing his shadow is 21 years  </p>
