        <p>Though this deleted scene would have easily solved some questions, removing Phil's curse from Groundhog Day ultimately makes for a better viewing experience.Initially, changes from the studio actually improved Danny Rubin's screenplay, but Rubin and producer Trevor Albert drew the line when an unnamed Columbia exec wanted an explanation for why Phil's day kept repeating. 
As wonderful a movie as Groundhog Day is, it never explains the nature of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) being trapped in a time loop.  The Deleted Scene.  10 Movies That Escaped The Dump Month  
Here, producer Trevor Albert and screenwriter Danny Rubin, recall the “curse” that nearly ruined the 1993 Bill Murray classic. Groundhog Day tells the story of disillusioned TV weatherman Phil, who, having travelled to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day event, finds himself reliving the same day over and over  
In a deleted scene, it is shown that the reason he is living through this is because of a magic curse an old girlfriend put on him. Of course, being a deleted scene makes it non-canon. Reply reply More replies 
Groundhog Day is maybe the most philosophical and interesting of all the comedies that involve someone getting a piano dropped on them. Bill Murray relives one day in his life, for seemingly no purpose, over and over. Due to the lack of explanation in the finished film, people have argued for years about what the heck the point of it all is.

Harold Ramis cut the reason Bill Murray's day keeps repeating in 'Groundhog Day'. His ex-girlfriend cast a curse on him with his broken watch (set at 5:59). His curse of 10,000 days was broken when Rita kisses him and can actually hear tinkling music, signifying the curse being lifted.

The cause of the time loop in Groundhog Day is never explained, but a deleted scene suggests it was a magical curse put on Phil as punishment for his selfish behavior. When he learns his lesson and spends the day being selfless and kind, the curse is broken, and time moves forward normally.

Because there are few better ways to end a day than with a reference to -- or better yet, a viewing of -- the 1993 Bill Murray comedy Groundhog Day, we'll close with a one-page comic from The Goon creator Eric Powell and Mac Cushing called "Groundhog Day: The Deleted Scene."

In the end they left it ambiguous saying that it was how ever long it takes to learn to play the piano. He also doesnt save the kid in the tree everyday. One scene in the hospital you see the kid getting his broken arm fixed in the background. Great movie. The scene where Phil comes on to Ned was completely ad libbed by Murray. 
Here is where this fan edit surpasses the original. While too many films nowadays are too long, bloated even, for little or no good reason, Groundhog Day, in my estimation, is too short. More could have been done in the original to show the extent of Phil's character growth and transformation, beyond the released deleted scenes. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) –
