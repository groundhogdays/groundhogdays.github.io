As wonderful a movie as Groundhog Day is, it never explains the nature of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) being trapped in a time loop.  The Deleted Scene. This scene was deleted in the truest sense  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman who keeps reliving the same day over and over. The film has had some significant impact since its release. It’s considered one of the greatest films of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest comedy movies ever.

Of course in the film, Phil saves Buster the Groundhog Day ringleader from choking by using the heimlich maneuver.
