        <h2><strong>groundhog day did phil die characters on groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Fans of Groundhog Day will be happy to know that its shining star, Punxsutawney Phil, has not died in 2022. Indeed, the famous animal emerged from his burrow on Feb. 2, 2022, and saw his shadow, predicting another extra six weeks of winter. 
Phil being held by a member of the Inner Circle on February 2, 2018. Punxsutawney Phil (/ Àå p  å ≈ã k s …ô Àà t …îÀê n i /) is a groundhog residing in Young Township near Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, United States, who is the central figure in Punxsutawney's annual Groundhog Day celebration. 
Several people were confused after the report, saying they thought Punxsutawney Phil died yesterday, a day before Groundhog Day, and the celebration was cancelled, but that is not the case.

In a video posted on TikTok Feb. 3, @olivesongs11 composed a song based on the lore that Punxsutawney Phil has been alive since 1886, and his longevity comes from an "elixir of life" that he takes  
When did Groundhog Day begin? In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time Groundhog Day appeared in the newspaper, according to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club . The following year brought the

A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days‚Äîjust under 34 years‚Äîreliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Fred la marmotte, Canada's Punxsutawney Phil, made his weather prediction every Groundhog Day, but Fred had "no vital signs" before this year's event.

Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks.

Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". Phil's reaction at the end of the movie is pretty unbelievable anyway. </p>
