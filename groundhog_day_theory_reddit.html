        <h2><strong>groundhog day theory reddit phim groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>He knows this apparently, because he's kept track of time by reading one page of a book every day. In the film, though not explicitly mentioned, I believe the timeline is shortened to around 10,000 days. My theory is that each day that Phil has been stuck in this time loop, time continues as normal for everyone else in that world. 
Groundhog Day never really ends, it’s a parasite that gets passed from person to person. That’s my theory. Let Me explain: There’s a theory on reddit that Phil Connors is in hell/purgatory and that Ned Ryerson is/was the devil (need link). This video covers that idea but doesn’t link the post. I remember reading it years ago here too. 
I just rewatched Groundhog Day (1993) with my wife last night. It's my favorite movie, and though I haven't watched it as much as some people , it's easily the movie I've seen the most times. This time through, I caught something real subtle that seems to be an entire hidden plot line in the film: I'm pretty sure Phil grew up in Punxsutawney  
Groundhog Day is a comedy classic and a fan theory about Bill Murray’s comedy classic has proven to be very popular on Reddit.The movie never explained why Phil Connors was trapped in a time  
The ever-persistent fan theory of Phil Connors' buying insurance to break his Groundhog Day curse adds a layer of meta-commentary to a movie that already has so much to say. 
Groundhog Day's Time Loop Begins With Ned Ryerson According to the theory, the time loop begins the first time Phil runs into Ned and is intended to get him to sign a contract. They're supposedly friends from high school, but Phil doesn’t recognize him, thinking the man is a fan instead.

According to one theory that was originally posted on Reddit, he's there under the control of the devil, who we actually meet early on in Groundhog Day. You'd be forgiven for missing him too  
Great theory. Just want to point out that, um, under the Unfair Trade Practices Act, this would be considered Coercion and possibly Rebating and is totally illegal. He could get fined up to 2,000 US dollars for each time he does this, which may or may not count as each day Phil is put into Time Limbo. However, the fines cannot exceed 50,000. 
Yesterday, marked Groundhog Day and a new fan theory about Bill Murray’s comedy classic has proven to be very popular on Reddit. Why Phil Connors was trapped in a time loop living the same day

[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
My sister and I annually watch this movie on Grounds Hogs day, and we always think that the bartender is in on it. My theory is that Phil is a looper, but I believe that the Bartender is someone who is aware of the loops, and is able to tell every time a loop occurs in which Phil interacts with him, hence the smirk. 
In my theory the first interaction with the alarm clock is just the start of a normal day. Had he not interacted with Ned he never would've experienced that moment with the alarm clock again. So I'm saying on the first day Ned damns Phil to continually start that day over and over, and he takes his first step into his cursed life. 
So we are to assume that Phil ONLY buys life insurance from Ned on the LAST Groundhog Day which we see in the movie? Despite the fact that he has probably done this “good” day almost exactly the same hundreds or thousands of times. Case in point, when catching the child falling from the tree, Phil exclaims, “You little brat! 
Life has gotten to a point where everybody does their daily grind, doing the same thing over and over, only to have to do it again the next day. Groundhog Day teaches Phil that you have to take life as it comes but in gaining an understanding of the people around you and being a better person to those people you can escape the monotony and have  
The theory makes even more sense when you consider that perhaps, like the actual Groundhog Day, the "point" of the loop is to make Ferris reconsider every aspect of his day and approach to life and actually achieve something by helping someone else (Cameron) and perfecting the romance in his life (Sloane) 
Re-watching Groundhog Day, something jumped out at me: on a number of occasions, Bill Murray's character dies and the movie continues instead of immediately jumping to the next day at 6:00 am. The first time is after Bill Murray drives off the cliff with the groundhog, the camera cuts to Larry and Rita for a few seconds. 
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes. 
Groundhog Day. This is the main circulating theory as far as I can tell, and it centers around the idea that all living creatures, after dying to something, wake right back up before they ever died, thus allowing them to continue living that same life. This theory has its merits, as it explains the gameplay mechanics quite well. </p>
