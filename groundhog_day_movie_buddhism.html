        <p>The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. 
The first draft of the screenplay for the movie, published in Rubin’s 2012 book “How to Write Groundhog Day,” included scenes with a Catholic priest and a street preacher. 
For a lot of people, Groundhog Day is simply a timeless time loop comedy that holds up just as well now as it did more than 30 years ago. On the other side of the coin, there are practitioners and devotees to the Buddhist lifestyle that maintain it speaks to them on a much deeper level than simply being a wildly entertaining ride, which isn’t  
Harold Ramis’ 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” is so entertaining, you’ll want to see it again, and again, and again. Explore meanings and central themes in the movie. 
Groundhog Day wonderfully exemplifies the power of approaching each moment as though it were a completely new experience. This is perfectly conveyed in Buddhist practice. When the bell rings in a  
The 1993 film shows Murray repeatedly experiencing a single day multiple times. Although the movie belongs to the comedy genre,  How ‘Groundhog Day’ Is The Ultimate Buddhism Movie  
Despite almost no mention of God or religion, the filmmakers of "Groundhog Day" made one of the more spiritual films of the era. “You can argue about whether it is a Buddhist, Christian or Jewish movie — but it is deeply religious,” said author and Boston University religion professor Stephen Prothero, who has shown the film in his classes. 
A few years later, in 2001, Groundhog Day was screened as part of a Buddhist film series organized by Michael Wenger, a Sōtō Zen priest who was then the dean of Buddhist studies at the San Francisco Zen Center. In a subsequent lecture, Wenger argued that Groundhog Day not only illustrates the law of karma, but also “parallels Buddhist  
Woodstock Willie, perhaps the second most famous groundhog in the country, saw his shadow Thursday (Feb. 2), predicting another six weeks of winter. The early morning prediction, viewed by a crowd who braved below-freezing temperatures, was part of a five-day celebration of the release of “Groundhog Day,” a now classic film starring Bill Murray released in 1993 and filmed in this small

And many references and motifs that recur in the film support the notion that “Groundhog Day” is Christian rather than Buddhist. “These sticky buns are heaven.” “When you stand in the  
The film Groundhog Day demonstrates the wonder of living each moment as a totally new event. It follows a day in the life of weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic curmudgeon. He wakes upon the same day, Groundhog Day, again, and again, and again. 
In an essay entitled “Groundhog Day The Movie, Buddhism and Me,” Spiritual Cinema Circle co-founder Stephen Simon calls the film “a wonderful human comedy about being given the rare  
The feeling of being trapped becomes unbearable; awakening to the prospect of another day just like yesterday yields nothing but despair. Groundhog Day is a movie about a bad-enough man—selfish, vain, and insecure—who becomes wise and good through timeless recurrence. Phil Conners (Bill Murray) is the weatherman at a Pittsburgh television  
Groundhog Day is a metaphor for that growth process and has become a common term now in modern life for a day that seems to go on forever. When a phrase from a movie takes on that kind of life ("Trust the force, Luke") there is something going on in our hearts and minds that extends well outside the confines of a strip of film.

Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
He answered, “Well, I’m a practicing Buddhist, and we believe in Buddhism that it takes 10,000 years to perfect the human soul, and that is the story of ‘Groundhog Day’—the perfection of the human soul.”
