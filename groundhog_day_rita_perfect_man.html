        <p>What Rita Wants from Groundhog Day meets Ghostbusters.This is just a silly bit of fun, this one. :-)Clips: Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2Music:  
Here Murray employs the laconic charm he perfected in Ghostbusters, as Phil plays the part of Rita’s perfect man, learning more about her each day, and superficially pleasing her, but ultimately failing every time to get her into bed. Rita tells Phil, “You’ll never love anyone but yourself.” He replies, “That’s not true. 
[Waking after a night of reading poetry and only chaste sleep with Rita, Phil jumps out of bed, determined to show himself as a new and likable man. He gives a wad of cash to the Old Man beggar and shows up early for the photo shoot, carrying a tray of coffees just the way that Rita and Larry like them, and with Larry's favorite pastry] 
I always pictured that the very beginning of the movie could have been Rita going through a heart ache or something traumatic and wishing to find the perfect man. Then Phil is cursed to repeat the day over and over again until he becomes the perfect man for Rita. So her falling in love quickly makes more sense. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 film about a weather man doomed to repeat the same day over  passed Groundhog Day] Rita  in "Groundhog Day: the perfect  
Phil and Rita are in the diner, and she's listing all the features of a perfect man. Phil feels he checks off most of them, but towards the middle gets hesitant ("Kind, sensitive, gentle, he's not afraid to cry in front of people", "he likes animals, children, he'll change poopy diapers"), and realizes straight-up that he's missed: "Oh, and he  
Groundhog Day (1993) - * Phil: So what do you want out of life anyway? * Rita: I guess I want what everybody wants. You know, career, love, marriage, children. * Phil: Are you seeing anyone? * Rita: I think this is getting too personal. I don't think I'm ready to share this with you. * [Phil nods] * Rita: How about you? What do you want? * Phil: What I really want is someone like you. * Rita  
Rita the deuteragonist, from the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day. She is the love interest of Phil Connors. Rita works with Phil at the start of the movie. Rita is a news producer, while Phil is the weatherman. The two are given an assignment where they have to go to Punxsutawney, PA, and cover the Groundhog Day festival they have there. Although Phil always had a slight crush on Rita, she at first  
Her response guides his future Groundhog Days right up until he breaks the loop. This is him first flying the idea past her (and us). Groundhog Day - Good Scene - The Perfect Man - Clip by Ari Lipiansky on Vimeo 
For Rita especially, the day ended up him saying "I Love You". Don't get me wrong, the movie is a solid portrayal of self-discover and realisation, just that I don't think I can unsee this in the next set of viewings. 
Rita (Andie MacDowell) hears Phil's (Bill Murray) beautiful piano playing and stories of his good deeds from the townsfolk. Impressed by his apparent transfo 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic.

However, Rita soon recognized it was a sham. As Rita said, “I could never love someone like you, Phil, because you’ll never love anyone but yourself.” Phil responded with, “That’s not true. I don’t even like myself.” Phil tried to re-create that same perfect day with Rita, only ending with her slapping him each time. 
The next day, Phil wakes up at six in the morning on February 2nd, Groundhog Day, which had already been yesterday. From that moment on, the awareness of the repeated day becomes solely Phil’s experience, as he watches in horror the same events unfold as the day before. No one, including Rita, believes his stories about the unexpectedly

just watched the movie and felt the same about ending. rita did not even see once phil helping others. i think they rushed this part to end the movie. perfect ending was where phil tells rita about everyone and then she decided to hangout. then phil tells about her in her sleep. this could have been perfect ending
