        <p>Edge of Tomorrow ' s debut in both Russia ($8.6 million) and South Korea ($3.8 million, taking advantage of a five-day holiday) marked Tom Cruise's highest-grossing opening weekend in both countries. [77] [78] Edge of Tomorrow was released in 3,490 theaters in North America on June 6, 2014. [79] 
A human-versus-aliens epic that keeps repeating the same scene over and over again as if the comic tilt of "Groundhog Day" had turned suddenly dangerous. But "Edge of Tomorrow" will keep you on  
If you’ve read anything at all about Edge of Tomorrow, it is likely that two of the words you’ve read have been “Groundhog Day,” and there’s good reason for this.Director Doug Liman’s  
“Edge of Tomorrow,” as everyone already knows, is a sci-fi war film with a “Groundhog Day”-like premise: Cruise plays a soldier who, after being killed in combat, awakens the day before  
“Groundhog Day” and “Starship Troopers” make surprisingly compatible bedfellows in “Edge of Tomorrow,” a cleverly crafted and propulsively executed sci-fi thriller in which an  
There have been many time loop movies in the history of cinema, including beloved titles like "Palm Springs" and "Groundhog Day."But there's never been one quite like "Edge of Tomorrow," which  
Tom Cruise has a killer case of déjà vu in “Edge of Tomorrow,” and he’s not the only one; viewers will pick out plot elements from “Groundhog Day,” “Starship Troopers,” “Source  
Somehow, the director of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith can produce quality films despite the chaos. 2014’s Edge of Tomorrow is no exception. Despite a reportedly tumultuous filming process, the science fiction take on Groundhog Day has been regarded as a cult classic. It had to earn this reputation though. 
Edge Of Tomorrow, Doug Liman’s click-clacky sci-fi take on Groundhog Day, stars Tom Cruise as a smarmy press flack who get stuck in a time loop during an alien invasion.An entertaining, effects  
Smartly re-titling the source novel (All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka) Edge Of Tomorrow, the structure – a la Groundhog Day – offers plenty of material for re-examination of a  
Director Harold Ramis might have made the perfect film when he released Groundhog Day in 1993.  Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise star in 2014’s sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow, which takes the idea  
When the sci-fi action flick Edge of Tomorrow was released there was a lot of talk about the similarities with the classic 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. You kno 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
A quick answer for me would be Groundhog Day. This would stem from the many articles and interviews discussing the length of several, if not thousands, of years that passed during Groundhog Day. Also, according to the novel Edge of Tomorrow is based on, the sequence only takes place over 393 days. 
Au programme : Groundhog Day (1993) / Edge Of Tomorrow (2014) 10 Days Left: The year is almost over—help us meet our 2024 goal! 
As improbable a concoction as it might seem, Edge of Tomorrow is a curious mix of ingredients from the 1993 Harold Ramis/Bill Murray comedy, Groundhog Day, and James Cameron's 1986 sequel to Alien. An Earth-versus-aliens tale set in the near future, Edge of Tomorrow offers a time travel twist to its proceedings. Unlike many movies that toy with  
I am looking for a movie where the day/event repeats, and the character tries to solve the problem that causes it, generally edge of tomorrow is probably my favorite movie of all time, I just really love this concept Sorry if it rubs someone the wrong way, but I can't stand older movies so only movies from 2005 and onwards 
While at the screening for this Tom Cruise actioner, I overheard someone say that Edge of Tomorrow was sort of a combination of the romcom fantasy Groundhog Day and the sci-fi blaster Starship Troopers. And that’s likely to be the type of cinematic comparisons many will make. 
About halfway through Edge of Tomorrow, our hero—played by Tom Cruise—is enjoying a drink in a bar.Fellow patrons argue over the alien invasion currently wrecking the planet. “It doesn’t  
Tom Cruise (‘Taps’) will be back in theaters, with his image projected onto a giant screen, on June 6 with a new movie titled ‘Edge of Tomorrow.’ In ‘Edge of Tomorrow,’ Cruise plays a  </p>
