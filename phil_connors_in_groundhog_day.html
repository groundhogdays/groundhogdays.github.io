Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly.

Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Tom Dunkel, explained to WTAJ. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That

Phil loathes the annual celebration and is surly throughout the proceedings, wanting  
In one of his finest roles, Bill Murray plays sarcastic and arrogant Pittsburgh weather forecaster Phil Connors in Harold Ramis' 1993 masterpiece, Groundhog Day.Phil believes that he's destined  
Still, it’s perfectly sensible to wonder what happened to Phil Connors after his years of endless Groundhog Days. Phil experienced thousands of February 2nds, learned to be a better man, then
