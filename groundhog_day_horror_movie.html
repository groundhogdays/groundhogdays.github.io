        <p>Happy Death Day takes a humorous Groundhog Day approach to the slasher movie, at once proving how well the slasher meshes with other genres as well as introducing an unconventional Final Girl that  
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre.

[11] Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over.

While there is an entire genre of great Halloween movies, countless beloved Christmas classics, and even a few films that celebrate the American Thanksgiving holiday, Groundhog Day is the  
Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. 
Groundhog Day isn't the only movie to feature characters trapped in a time loop. We run down 14 other films that have a similar plot.  • “Happy Death Day” is a horror movie about a woman  
From Happy Death Day to In the Tall Grass, these 10 great horror movies use the concept of time loops in the most terrifying of ways.

Groundhog Day Was a Horror Movie All Along The 1993 existential comedy has become a meme and a metaphor for this moment. But that’s only partly because of its exploration of monotony. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Recut version of the 1993 film Groundhog Day in the horror/suspense genre. 
Small things like lighting, music, camera angles, the look on an actor's face etc can make a massive difference as to whether a movie comes across as a horror or a comedy. Given that Groundhog Day was made by some of the finest comic veterans in the industry, I think it's a fair bet to say that it was never meant to be a horror movie.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
“Happy Death Day,” a horror riff on the “Groundhog Day” model, opens with the Universal logo stopping and restarting, just as the company name is circling the globe.
