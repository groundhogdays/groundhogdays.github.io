        <p>Reviews. Groundhog Day.  “Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold  Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his  
Every year on Feb. 2 he is dispatched to Punxsutawney, Pa., to cover the festivities of Groundhog Day, on which Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, is awakened from his slumbers and studied to discover if he will see his shadow. If he does, we will have another six weeks of winter. 
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review the 1993 film "Groundhog Day" starring Bill Murray and directed by Harold Ramis. Both critics gave the movie two thumbs up. 
Those films earned a second review with a Great Movie badge, many times earning a higher star rating than his first published review. Ebert's selection of Great Movies from the 1990s includes  
Roger Ebert Revisits Groundhog Day Posted on February 1, 2005 by sheila One of my favorite things that Ebert does as a reviewer is: he goes back and reviews films years after their release. 
– Roger Ebert. Sometimes, a movie is so light of foot that its brilliance goes unnoticed. A decade before LOST IN TRANSLATION, Bill Murray made his journey from sketch comedian to absurdist existentialist as the choleric weather reporter, Phil Connors, in Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY. 
I don't get how groundhog day gets so much praise and even considered a great movie by roger ebert. It felt like just a movie you go to with your kids to bond like home alone. 
Just gave this a rewatch. 30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun.

The opening to Roger Ebert’s Review of Groundhog Day: ‘Groundhog Day’ is a film that finds its note and purpose so precisely that its genius may not be immediately noticeable. It unfolds so inevitably, is so entertaining, so apparently effortless, that you have to stand back and slap yourself before you see how good it really is. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
When Roger Ebert inducted “Groundhog Day” into his Great Movies series in 2005, he admitted that he underrated the film in his original review. “I enjoyed it so easily that I was seduced into cheerful moderation,” Ebert wrote. “But there are a few films, and this is one of them, that burrow into our memories and become reference points. 
This past Groundhog Day in Chicago, Erica joined Bill Murray and other members of the “Groundhog Day” cast to honor Harold’s life at Harry Caray’s Tavern on Navy Pier. RogerEbert.com Literary Editor Matt Fagerholm spoke with many of the participating actors beforehand, including Stephen Tobolowsky , who stole all of his scenes as the  
"Life might very well lack purpose, and it might very well be a struggle. But that doesn't mean you have to be an asshole about it." So writes Ali Arikan in his thoroughly illuminating (and not at all repetitious) "Imagining Sisyphus Happy: A 'Groundhog Day' Retrospective" at The House Next Door. This is one of those appreciations that lights up the movie from within, and makes you happy

“Happy Death Day,” a horror riff on the “Groundhog Day” model, opens with the Universal logo stopping and restarting, just as the company name is circling the globe. It’s a clever riff on the fact that audiences know what they’re coming to see—a film in which the same events repeat over and over again. 
When Roger Ebert originally reviewed Groundhog Day, he gave it three stars.  This article also links to Ebert's contemporaneous review of The Life Aquatic which he  
“Palm Springs,” directed by Max Barbakow (his feature film debut), is a very interesting and thought-provoking experience. It often made me laugh out loud. The cast—Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, J.K. Simmons, Peter Gallagher, Meredith Hagner—is so talented, so in the zone with the material that they crackle with unexpected character development, absurdity, flaws, humor. 
Just in time for Valentine’s Day, “50 First Dates” is a spin on the “Groundhog Day” notion of a day that keeps repeating itself. This time, though, the recycling takes place entirely inside the mind of Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), who was in an accident that caused short-term memory loss. 
Cast members from one of the most beloved films of all time, director/co-writer Harold Ramis‘ 1993 classic, “Groundhog Day,” will have their first official reunion at 3pm CT on Friday, February 2nd, in Chicago to honor the tenth anniversary of the celebrated filmmaker’s passing on February 24th, 2014. </p>
