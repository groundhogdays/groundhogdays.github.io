Stephen Harold Tobolowsky (born May 30, 1951) is an American character actor and writer. He is known for film roles such as insurance agent Ned Ryerson in Groundhog Day [1] and amnesiac Sammy Jankis in Memento, as well as such television characters as Commissioner Hugo Jarry in Deadwood, Bob Bishop in Heroes, Sandy Ryerson in Glee, Stu Beggs in Californication and White Famous, "Action" Jack  
All the ned scenes. The annoying old school friend who you don't remember pestering you to buy insurance.. 
It’s Groundhog Day, everyone – and in addition to letting a rodent tell us if we’ll suffer through another six weeks of winter, it’s also the perfect day to look back at the best quotes from that annoying former high school classmate-turned-insurance-salesman who pesters Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors into buying life insurance in the classic 1993 film “Groundhog Day.” 
Ned Ryerson, the pushy insurance salesman from Groundhog Day, is one of the greatest characters to have ever graced the silver screen. According to Danny Rubin in his book “How to Write Groundhog Day” he came up with Ned Ryerson’s personality and job based on an encounter that he had had with an actual insurance salesman. 
Remind readers about the comical life insurance salesman character in the movie “Groundhog Day.” Note that in reality, many Americans find themselves needing the kind of advice such financial professionals can provide. Detail how many financial professionals provide protection planning as part of an overall financial strategy. 
Unlike Bill Murray's character in "Groundhog Day," you probably didn't go to high school with Ned Ryerson.. But you've never forgotten the endearingly annoying insurance salesman known for awkward  
If there’s one character from the movie Groundhog Day that will always make you laugh, it’s Ned Ryerson. Played by the talented Stephen Tobolowsky, Ned is the epitome of an annoying insurance salesman who just can’t take a hint. With his high-pitched voice and enthusiastic personality, Ned’s quotes are guaranteed to leave you in stitches. 
The first description that Phil provides of the annoying insurance salesman that accosts him on the sidewalk first thing in the morning every day is that is a “giant leech.” Ned is thus invested with symbolic meaning as the personification of the very concept of insurance as a force with the ability to influence the course of one’s life.

2- Groundhog Day. This is my favorite movie on the list. Groundhog Day didn’t make much of an impression when it came out, although it was popular. But it’s really done well in hindsight. Groundhog Day has famously been called “the most spiritual movie ever made”. 
One person who particularly loves Groundhog Day is Stephen Tobolowsky, the veteran character actor who plays the adorably obnoxious insurance salesman Ned Ryerson. In addition to being the source

In the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character experiences a time loop where he is forced to relive the same day repeatedly. This phenomenon causes him to undergo personal growth and self-reflection as he tries to break free from the cycle by changing his actions and attitudes towards others. 
Funny Scene with Phil's old classmate. 'Groundhog Day' is a 1993 American comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Ne 
Actor Stephen Tobolowsky, who plays insurance agent Ned Ryerson in the "Groundhog Day" movie, will greet fans Saturday at the Groundhog Days festival in Woodstock, Illinois. 
Their exchange only gets funnier with each repeated day, as Phil workshops approaches that might save him from the wacky former schoolmate, who is now an insurance salesman (obviously).
