James L. Morris, a Welsh shopkeeper, first mentioned the tradition in a diary entry dated February 2, 1840: ‚ÄúToday the Germans say the groundhog comes out of his winter quarters,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúand if he sees his shadow he returns and remains there for 40 days.‚Äù

The first official Groundhog Day was reported on February 2nd, 1840 in Morgantown, Pennsylvania. But why did they use a groundhog instead of a badger or a bear? Well, there were more groundhogs (or woodchucks) in Pennsylvania than in Germany so it only made sense to use a similar animal that hibernated and then returned after winter.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
It is becoming clearer and clearer that Groundhog Day (1993), directed by Harold Ramis, is one of the masterpieces of 1990s Hollywood cinema.One of the first films to use a science-fiction premise as the basis for romantic comedy, it tells the story of a splenetic TV weatherman, Phil Connors (Bill Murray at his disreputable best), who finds himself indefinitely repeating one drab day in
