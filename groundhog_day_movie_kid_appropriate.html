For a 90's PG movie the language is exceptionally mild and soft. The comedic suicide scenes are meant to prove a lesson to the main character. They are comedic and exaggerated and actually have an anti-suicide message in that the main character has to re-live Groundhog Day until he becomes a nicer, more decent person. 
Being forced to live the same day repeatedly, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) learns that there has to be more to life than a meaningless GROUNDHOG DAY. Set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Phil, a TV weatherman, has been sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities and finds himself caught in a time warp.

Groundhog Day has always been one of my favorite comedies. It has a great premise and some of the best character actors in a single film. "Ned, Ned Ryerson"! The movie is such a great comedy I'm always caught off guard by the scenes where the old man dies. It is such a heart tugging collection of moments that never fails to bring a tear to my eye. 
“Groundhog Day” stars Bill Muray as an egotistical TV weather man who has been sent to Punxsutawney, PA to cover Groundhog Day (February 2nd).
