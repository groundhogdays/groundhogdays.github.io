Curmudgeonly weatherman Phil Connors is stuck reliving Groundhog Day over and over again until he finds love and the meaning of life. But as a cocktail enthusiast, Phil’s drink order (sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist) always bothered me. 
One of my favorite Bill Murray movies, “Groundhog Day” is 25 years old this year (yikes, it’s the age of someone who can rent a car).
