        <h2><strong>groundhog day full movie reddit what song is played in groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun. Poignant moments, funny momentsI mean Bull Murray was the perfect lead for this. And such a satisfying character arc. There is nothing unnecessary in this movie either. 
"Groundhog Day" was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year, garnering over $105 million at the box office. It also won the BAFTA Award for best original screenplay. The movie is available

Bill Murray is at his wry, wisecracking best in this riotous romantic comedy about a weatherman caught in a personal time warp on the worst day of his life. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott

Groundhog Day film 1993 reddit Just a sub for fans, and for any and all things related to the 1993 Harold Ramis "Groundhog Day" film, starring Bill Murray, Andie McDowell, Chris Elliot, Stephen Tobolowsky--and Scooter the Groundhog. 
I'm looking for a movie similar to the style of Groundhog Day,any suggestions? Like full of humour but at its heart is a really profound message about living the life positively. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
I think "Groundhog Day" is the best movie ever made. The story of a cursed man gaining redemption is my favorite. The 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is like classic literature. 
Not exactly about reliving a day, but time travel: Timecrimes (2007). It's not wholesome tho. Also Predestination (2014), about time travel Edit: Source Code (2011)! This one actually does have the "repete the same event" formula. All of these are more action/sci-fi, not about life lessons like Groundhog Day 
35 votes, 73 comments. I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect 
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years. 
None of those things make any fucking sense lol I live in a shithole country called Croatia,i was at a big park last week with my 4 year old kid, im a reasonably big dude with a mohawk, shitty ripped shirt,army pants and a large juvenile record so i dont really look like your regular dude, there was a bunch of cops at the entrance since public gatherings are limited and we playfully teased  
In Groundhog Day at the end of the scene where Phil Connor breaks several clocks in a row, he throws a clock to the floor and we see a short still image of the clock in pieces on the floor. In this image you can see bottom left a Copal II motor which runs the clock mechanism, you can see two bolt holes either side of the round motor housing  </p>
