        <h2><strong>how many days was groundhog day movie groundhog day bill murray commercial</strong></h2>
        <p>The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
These included the 38 "days shown on screen", the 414 "days mentioned" (including the "six months, four to five hours a day" spent throwing playing cards into a hat), and the colossal 11,931 "days  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number

Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
In one early version of the script it stated that phil spent 10000 days (27 years) repeating the same day. Many people contemplate this though and argue that he only spent around 10 years. Either way, its still a LONG time.

In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“
