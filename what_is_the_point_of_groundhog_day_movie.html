        <h2><strong>what is the point of groundhog day movie groundhog day va</strong></h2>
        <p>Harold Ramis’ 1993 film, Groundhog Day, is a charming and heartwarming comedy about an arrogant egotistical weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has a change of heart over the course  
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
This year is also the 25th anniversary of the movie "Groundhog Day." (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "GROUNDHOG DAY") MURRAY: (As Phil) A thousand people freezing their butts off, waiting to worship a rat. 
The 1993 movie is deeper than you might think.  Groundhog Day as life metaphor: Most of us have at some point been trapped in a situation where no matter what we did, we couldn’t extricate  
Groundhog Day (1993) Plot Summary &amp; Movie Synopsis: On February 1, PBH TV weatherman Phil Connors assures his viewers, who are situated in Pittsburgh, that they can, without any doubt, stop worrying about a blizzard that will just fall short of hitting Western Pennsylvania. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
Groundhog Day marked a transition in Bill Murray's career. In the early '90s, Bill Murray was at the beginning of the end of his "movie star" Hollywood phase, a period lasted for almost the entire 1980s; soon afterGroundhog Day, he would be making one of his first inimitable turns as a character actor, in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. 
I’ve made a point of rewatching the film on or about Groundhog Day nearly every year since the movie came out in 1993. “Groundhog Day” stars Bill Murray as a snobby urban weatherman  
Even if you haven’t seen the film you know the basic plot, because the term “Groundhog Day” has entered the vernacular — which alone speaks to its resonance beyond the film itself — as  
Michael P. Foley has a great article in Touchstone Magazine exploring some of the philosophical aspects of the movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Ranging from Nietzsche to Machiavelli and Aristotle to Augustine, Foley examines the movie from the vantage point of both philosophy and theology. Here is my favorite excerpt: 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. More: Where to watch Bill Murray's 1993 classic movie 'Groundhog Day' for Groundhog Day. What is  
Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, February 2. Today, of all days, Pittsburgh TV weatherman Phil Connors is about to experience a bizarre phenomenon during the town's annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festival. 
Groundhog Day. Movie: Directed by Harold Ramis, Screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis. Inciting Event: After covering Groundhog Day and being stuck in Punxsutawney, Phil wakes again at 6AM to his clock radio playing “I’ve Got You Babe,” the same song (a recurring motif of the film) as the previous day . He realizes it is not a radio  
“Groundhog Day” is, probably, one of the most interesting and memorable movies, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It is a comedy directed by Harold Ramis in 1993. The point is that the plot of the film gets better and better each time the viewer watches it. 
Screenplay Genre: Comedy / Fantasy / Romance Movie Time: 101 minutes. Phil Connors (Bill Murray), the weatherman of Pittsburgh Channel 9, goes to Punxsutawney with producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) to report February 2: the oldest Groundhog Festival in America.

Groundhog day with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is on many peoples Top 10 favorite movies of all time. But who knew that the movie has deep philosophical and Christian themes – in fact, it is a very Catholic. The Theology of Groundhog Day The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil–a weatherman who finds himself re-living a single day of his life–Groundhog Day. If you haven’t seen the movie  
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
So the movie actually switches point of view from his voiceover to hers." Point of view change! While I think Groundhog Day made the right changes, this ending sounds like a really fun way to mirror the original opening and voiceover. </p>
