The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58

Enjoy these funny Groundhog Day jokes and puns! Groundhog Day is observed on February 2nd each year, and according to legend a groundhog will pop its head out of the ground on this day.

Groundhog Day has since taken on the colloquial meaning of repetition and déjà vu.

In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie.

Groundhog Day Movie bloopers, mistakes goofs and flubs. Plus Bloopers and mistakes in movies, TV, books, and more. Thousands of bloopers make it into even the biggest movies, and some of these mistakes are very entertaining, if you know where to look. 
In Groundhog Day, time seems literally endless. But for us, on this Earth, time is a finite thing—and often, the time given to us feels oh so short. Because of Groundhog Day’s time loop, Phil Connors has the opportunity to live the day again and again—correcting mistakes, perfecting approaches, honing himself into, well, a decent human  
Groundhog Day (1993) - Revealing mistakes - When Phil is helping the ladies with the flat tire, he's using a jack to raise the car. Two shots are used (one showing Phil, the other showing the ladies in the car) as Phil is jacking the car up. But the car never gets any higher off of the ground like it's supposed to. It just bounces up and down to the original starting point.
