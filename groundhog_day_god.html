        <p>Groundhog Day - Phil's a God: Phil (Bill Murray) tries to explain to a skeptical Rita (Andie MacDowell) that he is a God.BUY THE MOVIE:  
The whole playlist of Groundhog Day (1993):  below:=====0:00 "He was a reall 
Phil, a self-centred weatherman, goes to the town of Punxsutawney for an assignment. He is later shocked when he wakes up the next morning and realises that  
February 2, 2013, was Groundhog Day. The tradition of observing Groundhog Day is based on a Pennsylvania German custom whereby a groundhog’s behavior on February 2 serves as a means of predicting if spring will come soon or if winter will hang on for another six weeks. 
The Feast of Candlemas is also known as the Feast of Christ’s Presentation in the Temple. It commemorates the day when 40 days after his birth, according to Jewish custom, Jesus Christ would have been brought to the Jerusalem Temple so that his mother could be ritually purified and he offered to God (with a sacrifice of “two turtle doves”!). 
Punxsutawney Phil is not the only weather predicting groundhog in America, just the most famous, thanks to Clymer Freas, who was the editor of the Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper in 1886. On February 2, 1886, Freas issued the following proclamation: “Today is groundhog day and up to the time of going to press the beast has not seen its shadow.” 
“I’m a god,” TV weatherman Phil Connors tells his producer, Rita Hanson, in a small town diner on February 2, also known by the title of the late director Harold Ramis’ film, Groundhog Day (1993). Phil has been having a bad day, for a long time – about “30 or 40 years,” Ramis estimates. Phil (played by Bill Murray) tells Rita  
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
I’d suggest Groundhog Day can also be read as a fable of Christian sanctification. The key to unlocking that view comes in a scene set in a diner, where Phil supplies proof of his predicament and debates his possible divinity with Rita. “I’m a god. I’m not the God, I don’t think,” he says. Walking Rita around the diner, he relays  
Just as the groundhog emerges from its burrow after a period of darkness, we are reminded of the spiritual awakening we can experience through our faith in God. In Psalm 30:5, we find solace in the words, “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.” 
Based on this scene, how many times has Bill Murray been through this day? 
Groundhog Day. The bartender also knew what was going on. Watch this scene, notice his smirk and chuckle at 1:56. 
Many popular holidays, like Groundhog Day, Valentine’s Day, and Mardi Gras, have roots in pagan worship practices and rituals, making them incompatible with biblical teachings. While often celebrated today as secular fun, scripture calls us to reject such traditions and align our lives with God’s ways. 
Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
Its premise is simple — Murray plays a weatherman, named Phil Connors, that becomes trapped in a time loop on Groundhog Day. Part of what makes this movie so great is the script and all of these famous Groundhog Day quotes.

The magical rise and soul-crushing fall of Groundhog Day in small-town N.J.  Oh my god,” recalled Daniel Holsten, 76, who has lived or worked in Milltown his entire life. 
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world.
