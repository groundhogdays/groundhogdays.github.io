        <p>Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
One Writer Finally Deciphers The Groundhog Day Timeline. On February 2, 2011, former editor and COO of WhatCulture, Simon Gallagher, wrote a more in-depth article analyzing Groundhog Day’s events and pieced together his own timeline. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. [9] 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
However, in 2009 he admitted the estimate was far too short. He said: "It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years." The site methodically reassessed Groundhog Day looking at three stages of the film.

In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. 
Yeah that would defeat the whole purpose of the film. He would just live one day and then move on to the following day without realizing he was stuck in a 10,00 year loop. The point of his mental state remembering every day was his punishment for not appreciating life and being a total douche bag until he realized this. 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. Phil lived his life constantly pushing others away, trying to be aloof, above, and fake. 
In which case, the number of Groundhog Days that Phil looped through could be greatly increased if he wakes up at 6A every morning and it resets at midnight, then at most he can only experience 18 hours per day, meaning he needs to wake up to 5 mornings just to accumulate 4 full days of experience. 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
In the Groundhog Day-esque  Sarah asks Nyles what he did before he got stuck in the same day. He can’t remember.  Sarah hasn’t been in the time loop as long as Nyles — but considering  
Darn, I had a similar theory I was waiting to post on Groundhog Day. Oh well, here's my addendum: Phil's actions do not let him escape the time loop. Every timeline in which he survives continues, and in all of those a version of Phil wakes up the next day thinking he's broken free. 
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  
Punxsutawney Phil controls the time loop. The Seer of Seers and Prognosticator of Prognosticators was deeply offended when Connors called him a "large squirrel predicting the weather." Phil isn't a squirrel and he isn't predicting shit. He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. 
He had to learn to be less selfish to break the spell. He was in the loop for at least somewhere between 10-50 years, just given the skills he manages to master. But it could have been as long as ten thousand years if you figure he probably wasted quite a few days beyond the ones we saw. </p>
