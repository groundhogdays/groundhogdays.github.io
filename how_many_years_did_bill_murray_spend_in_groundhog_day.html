        <p>According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
How many times did Bill Murray relive Groundhog Day?  director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the day for 10,000 years before later saying it was probably about 10 years. 
Which puts us at the grand total of 3176 repeated Groundhog days, or 453 weeks, or 105 months, or 8.7 years. Precisely, 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days. So in the end, Harold Ramis was right and we wasted a Bill Murray length of time trying to work it our ourselves. We will never be able to get this time back. Ever. 
Enough on the event, now to the movie. How exactly do we know how long Bill Murray spent in Groundhog day? Well, some bright sparks with obviously a lot of free time on their hands calculated that he relived the day 12,395, or 33 years and 350 days. Remember we said it was longer than Harold Ramis thought. 
A separate very involved analysis confirmed the 30-40 year estimate. "Just How Many Days Does Bill Murray REALLY Spend Stuck Reliving ‘Groundhog Day’?", WhatCulture. 33 years and 358 days (12,403 days) 
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day." According to their findings, Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a period totaling eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie

“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day.

Which puts us at the grand total of 3176 repeated Groundhog days, or 453 weeks, or 105 months, or 8.7 years. Precisely, 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days.So, in the end Harold Ramis was right and I wasted a Bill Murray length of my time. 
For me it had to be—I don't know. A hundred years. A lifetime." In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. </p>
