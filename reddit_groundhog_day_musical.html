        <p>Groundhog Day was the first musical theatre sheet music book I bought - I figured "If I can play this, I can play anything". I can still only fumble my way through a couple of the songs (Minchin is a musical genius), but I do play through it regularly.

Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY

Groundhog Day, a new musical about a man who must experience the same day over and over until he gets it right, opens August 16 at London's Old Vic Theatre. Based on the popular 1993 film comedy  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical.Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
At times, Groundhog Day feels more like a plate-spinning magic trick than a Broadway musical. 9 ‘Groundhog Day’ Broadway Review: Andy Karl, a Star Is Reborn and Reborn 
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example.

Groundhog Day is coming to Australia next year and I have tickets. It was meant to be me and my husband going, but he’s now not able to make the trip - as it’s in the next state down so it’s at least an overnight stay. I have a huge shortage of musical friends irl, and none of them are keen on Groundhog Day, so I’ve tried that option. 
Also my all time favorite. I always really like comedies that are light on the plot, where it just seems to be 90 minutes of random shit happening. Groundhog Day, Friday, Office Space, Superbad, The Other Guys, etc.
