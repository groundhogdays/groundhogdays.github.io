This was a  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks.

If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The legendary groundhog’s name comes from Punxsutawney, the Pennsylvania town that has hosted the largest Groundhog Day celebration since 1887. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club also claims that he was named after King Philip, although exact details remain vague. “Phil” received his official name in the 1960s, which cemented Punxsutawney  
The name Punxsutawney comes from the Indian name for the location "ponksad-uteney" which means "the town of the sand flies."
