        <h2><strong>why is there a time loop in groundhog day what groundhog is used for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Time and time again I marvel at what may be the reason the loop ends and find different answers each time. To me that's the true greatness of this movie: it's like a painting that's a bit different each time you see it and while you evolve and understand the world a little different, your conclusions on this movie evolveand change with you. 
The writers were right in their decision to remove this part from the draft because it detracts from the nuances of the terrifying loop, which forced Connors to reflect on his actions and become a better man. In fact, the randomness of this crippling phenomenon is the major reason why Groundhog Day works so well as a philosophical text. You don  
Here we go again: Time loop stories were around long before the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. So a friendly reminder that one person's discovery of something isn't the same as its invention. 
Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Is there a deeper meaning to the time loop in Groundhog Day? The time loop can be interpreted as a metaphor for the repetitive nature of life and the opportunity it presents for personal growth and transformation. 12. Why is Groundhog Day considered a comedy? While Groundhog Day deals with profound themes, it is considered a comedy due to its  
The cause and end of the time loop in Groundhog Day (1993) What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while  
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

Even those who have never seen “Groundhog Day” are familiar with the film’s premise. The protagonist, Bill Murray’s Phil, is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over. He attempts to escape the loop by changing something important, becoming familiar with the events that happen along the way and eventually growing as a  
He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
A janitor who works nearby is trapped in the same time loop and spends his time learning enough physics to understand what needs to be done to stop it, then finds the physicists, and spends a lot of time proving to them (repeatedly) that the physics is wrong. 
In a first draft of the script a spurned ex turns out to be a witch and curses him. This is specifically why, when Phil and Rita kiss at the end of the movie, there's a sound like tinkling bells (or whatever; doing this from memory). That was the moment th 
I thought that Ned was living the single day over and over, but without the cumulative knowledge of each day like Phil had. in essence, this would allow Ned only experienced the same day over and over without needing to go insane from the sensory overload, while also being able to recognize the day Phil decided to buy his insurance and thus reverse the loop. 
The episode "Groundmouse Day" has Brain repeatedly trying to take over the world by co-opting a Groundhog Day ceremony, while stuck in a time loop, in a parody of Groundhog Day. Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned in the film, plays the radio DJ in this episode. 
After reading trivia that said there were easter eggs regarding why Tree was stuck in the time loop, my husband said it had to do with the candle. He pointed out that each time we saw Lori hand Tree the cupcake, the candle blew out. Even when Tree placed the cupcake on the table, the shutting of the door made the candle blow out. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
To escape the time loop we must realize that we are all stuck in a time loop and there is no escape. And thats what Bill Murray meant when he said “Winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But standing here among the people of Punxsutawney and basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts, I couldn’t imagine a better fate than  
I think it's much more interesting when there is some consequence to a 'failed' loop - in a Sci-fi esque show there was an episode dedicating to a loop with a countdown of loops leading to inevitable demise, if they don't figure out a solution. Two characters looped; one always remembered prior loops, whereas the second only remembered loops  </p>
