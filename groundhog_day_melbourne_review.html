        <h2><strong>groundhog day melbourne review review of groundhog day musical</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is playing at the Princess Theatre until April 20. This production is a Melbourne exclusive and won’t be travelling interstate. Tickets are on sale now and you can get yours here . 
Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl. 
A musical adaptation of the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin. The show follows the journey of a TV weatherman trapped in a loop, reliving the same day over and over, and features a stellar cast, stunning illusions, and a philosophical twist. 
Groundhog Day The Musical is perfection - 5 Stars! Fun and witty, with elements of dark humour, yet also philosophically heart-warming. This musical provides an excellent psychological examination  
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
Groundhog Day the Musical currently playing at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre delivers an outstanding and captivating performance that leaves the audience thoroughly entertained. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the beloved film seamlessly blends humor, heart, and catchy tunes to create an unforgettable experience. 
A production like ‘Groundhog Day’, which plays with an interesting, clever premise. . . Is the perfect place for Tim Minchin to be. He’s totally in tune and totally up for the task, creating a soundtrack that captured the chaos of repetition without being annoying, and instead being head-shakingly intelligent. 
Content warning: this review contains references to self-harm and suicide. Phil Connors, the protagonist of Groundhog Day – both in the original 1993 film and in the musical theatre version – is condemned to live the same day over and over again until he learns some fundamental truths about himself, and figures out how he can become a better human being. 
Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors and in the story of this show, Andy Karl has been Phil Connors since the beginning. It may just be that no one else could play this role as well as Andy Karl and given he has opened this show in London on two different occasions, in New York and now in Melbourne, there’s certainly no one more  
Groundhog Day The Musical The Epitome of Artistry, Unveils a Time-Bending Symphony of Talent Reviewed by Brendan Daynes Groundhog Day The Musical has premiered at Melbourne's Princess Theatre on Thursday, February 1st, showcasing the collaborative brilliance of Tim Minchin, Danny Rubin, and Matthew Warchus. With a record-breaking return at London's Old Vic, this production, is 
The Melbourne cast of Groundhog Day is led by Olivier Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated Andy Karl as Phil Connors - the cynical TV weatherman who finds himself caught in a time loop when sent  
Groundhog Day had its world premiere and enjoyed a critically acclaimed strictly limited 10 week season at The Old Vic Theatre, London, in the summer of 2016.. One of the most ambitious shows ever to have been staged at The Old Vic, previews began on the 15th July. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics.

It's been 30 years since the movie Groundhog Day was released, where a cynical weatherman wakes up to find that he's stuck in a time loop, repeating the same day over and over and over again. The audience gets to watch his journey of personal growth before finally breaking this repetitive soul destroying cycle. 
The Australian company of GWB Entertainment’s Groundhog Day The Musical will welcome their first audiences this week at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, the production will play an exclusive 13-week season in Melbourne with sold out preview performances from Wednesday 24  
It's been 30 years since the movie Groundhog Day was released, where a cynical weatherman wakes up to find that he's stuck in a time loop, repeating the same day over and over and over again. The audience gets to watch his journey of personal growth before finally breaking this repetitive soul destroying cycle. 
Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
And of course, it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is back in the role of Phil Connors at the Old Vic, where he and the show won rave reviews in 2016, only for the subsequent New York run  
As Andy Karl prepares to play the lead in the Melbourne premiere of Groundhog Day, the irony that this is his fourth time in the role isn’t wasted on him. As anyone who has seen the 1993 film  </p>
