        <p>Edge of Tomorrow ' s debut in both Russia ($8.6 million) and South Korea ($3.8 million, taking advantage of a five-day holiday) marked Tom Cruise's highest-grossing opening weekend in both countries. [77] [78] Edge of Tomorrow was released in 3,490 theaters in North America on June 6, 2014. [79] 
Edge of Tomorrow: Directed by Doug Liman. With Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendan Gleeson, Bill Paxton. A man fighting in a war against aliens must relive the same day every time he dies until he can find a way to stop their power source with the help of an elite soldier. 
Tanna G Amazing movie definitely one of Tom cruises best films both leading actors did an amazing job i recommend to everyone to go watch or rewatch edge of tomorrow! Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5  
Film Review: ‘Edge of Tomorrow’ Tom Cruise stars in this cleverly crafted and propulsively executed sci-fi thriller about a soldier forced to relive the same day over and over again. 
The sci-fi premise employs a day-repeating, time-loop strategy made famous in 1993's Groundhog Day, but put to much grimmer use in this story of an alien invasion. 
As you may have heard, the new Tom Cruise movie is basically an alien-invasion Groundhog Day, in which our hero must live the same day over and over again, trying to do it a little better each  
In “Edge of Tomorrow,” Tom Cruise plays a military man caught in a time loop, destined to battle invading aliens day after day in a repeating bid to save Earth from Armageddon. 
Edge Of Tomorrow, Doug Liman’s click-clacky sci-fi take on Groundhog Day, stars Tom Cruise as a smarmy press flack who get stuck in a time loop during an alien invasion.An entertaining, effects  
Tom Cruise is the Groundhog Day grunt, and Emily Blunt the Angel Bitch, in Edge of Tomorrow, a furiously time-looping joy ride and the smartest action film of the early summer season.The movie’s  
Edge of Tomorrow is a film directed by Doug Liman with Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, Jonas Armstrong . Year: 2014. Original title: Edge of Tomorrow. Synopsis: In the near future during humanity's war against an invading alien race, untrained soldier William Cage (Tom Cruise) is thrown into a time loop, fighting and dying repeatedly. 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
IMDb, the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content. 
Top 25 Groundhog’s Day Type Movies/Shows.  Director Doug Liman Stars Tom Cruise Emily Blunt. 19. For All Time. 2000 1h 24m TV-PG. 6.9 (1.1K) Rate. TV Movie. 
Best Tom Cruise movie in the last 20 years. Reply reply  It's Groundhog Day if it had been conceived as a sci-fi action movie instead of a romantic comedy. 
As its leading man, Tom Cruise is central to "Edge of Tomorrow," especially as his gift for comedy really lends itself to the movie's wacky time-loop scenarios. But he wasn't always the first  
Tom Cruise’s Groundhog Day with Aliens Movie Gets Two New Posters I get the feeling Doug Liman ’s new sci-fi actioner “ Edge of Tomorrow ,” based on the Japanese novel “ All You Need is Kill ” (still a much better/awesome title if you ask me), will do okay in the States, but will clean up overseas. 
Tom Cruise's innovative sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow is streaming now on Netflix. Although Cruise has not starred in too many sci-fi films throughout his extensive Hollywood career , he has appeared in some of the best of the genre, including Steven Spielberg's Minority Report in 2002. 
Jack Reacher was pretty well recieved but it had a broader appeal since it was just another Tom Cruise action movie. Oblivion was really good but I could see how the it may not have scratched the sci-fi itch with the unoriginal story. This may have caused people to think Edge of Tomorrow was going to another generic Tom Cruise action sci-fi flick. 
The movie, directed by Doug Liman and co-starring the marvelous Emily Blunt, is a truly excellent bit of film making that could easily have gone off the rails. It deals with an alien invasion of Earth and has a definite "Groundhog Day" vibe given the fact that Cruise's character is stuck in a time loop. 
Tom Cruise has a killer case of déjà vu in “Edge of Tomorrow,” and he’s not the only one; viewers will pick out plot elements from “Groundhog Day,” “Starship Troopers,” “Source  </p>
