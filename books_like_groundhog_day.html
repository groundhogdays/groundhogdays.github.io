        <p>A murder mystery novel inspired by Agatha Christie with a dash of Groundhog Day and a hint of Quantum Leap and Downton Abbey.If that doesn’t make you want to read The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton, then maybe this will. 
In a Holidaze by Christina Lauren – The book that inspired this list! I enjoyed the advanced ebook I received so much, I ordered the book in paperback. I’m eager to reread it this holiday season. Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver – One of the first time loop books I remember reading, this one blew me away. I still find myself thinking about it. 
Just in time for Groundhog’s Day (the holiday), we have a list of great time loop novels like Groundhog’s Day (the movie)! Just kidding!

It can also be a book that starts and finishes on the same day without necessarily doing multiple repeats. These stories can be loads of fun or utterly flop. The trick is in the scenarios the writer is conveying.

It's been years since I read this book. It was interesting but I thought it was a bit odd. I read book 2 Hollow City as well, but I haven't kept up with the series.

Oh, I enjoyed the movie, but a lot of the book covered the internal thought process which were in the book was not carried over in the movie.
