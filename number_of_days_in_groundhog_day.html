        <h2><strong>number of days in groundhog day music groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Keeping the total number of days to 14 may, in a 1990s studio exec's thinking, have been more palatable to the average sitcom audience.  Whichever doctrine you apply to Groundhog Day,  
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
Just how many days does Phil Connors spend trapped in the perpetual loop of Groundhog Day?  England and Wales company registration number 2008885.  
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
Groundhog Day is an offshoot of the Christian celebration of Candlemas, which is held every February 2—exactly 40 days after Christmas. In parts of Europe, it was believed that a sunny Candlemas  
The surprising history of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil's rise to fame goes back thousands of years.  This feast day, called Candlemas, falls 40 days after Christmas, marking the end of  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
Director Harold Ramis believed Phil Connors was trapped for 10-40 years, adding weight to his loathing of the curse. Initially, the script envisioned a 10,000 year time-loop, but was reduced to  
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
I’ve been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. It’s possible that Phil was exaggerating, but the script says that Rita saw only “good, true things” in Phil’s eyes, so the number probably wasn’t intended to be a complete fabrication. This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. 
"Groundhog Day" revolves around a time loop where the main character, Phil Connors, relives the same day repeatedly. The exact number of days Phil experiences in the time loop is not explicitly stated, but estimates suggest he could have lived the same day for several years.

If the temperature rises above 40 degrees, the day is considered to be atypical. At the end of the six weeks, the total number of typical and atypical weather days is tallied. 
This translates to about four weeks' worth of days after Groundhog Day of morning lows at least dipping to the freezing mark in New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis; at least 45 such freezing  
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
To get to this number, Gallagher began counting each separate day shown onscreen in Groundhog Day, which adds up to 38 days total. Next, he calculated all the different events that Phil mentions
