The majority of the filming for Groundhog Day took place in Woodstock, Illinois, a small town located about 50 miles northwest of Chicago that doubled as Punxsutawney. Ramis and Murray visited 60 locations all across the country before deciding on Woodstock, which was chosen because it is close to their hometown, Chicago.

Besides the bandstand, it also features a gazebo and is the setting for many art galleries, antique stores, shops, and eateries in the town. It is also home to an array of events in and around the area and a popular film site for this hit classic movie.
