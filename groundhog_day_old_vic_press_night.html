I just saw Groundhog Day in London at the Old Vic last night andholy cow! I knew the story since it’s one of my favorite movies, knew one song, and knew I was dying to see Andy Karl in person. Beyond that, I pretty much went in blind.

Finally saw it in Old Vic last night. I was fortunate to catch it in NYC in 2017 ( as other shows I wanted to see were sold out!!) But I'm so happy as the show blew me away and has jumped to one of my all time favourites which made the wait too see it again more frustrating as I tried convince everyone to go see it! 
A good performer would have played the broad strokes; with impeccable timing and charismatic presence he plays the detail. It is an outstanding performance at the centre of a magnificent work that sends everyone out into the night cheering – and just a little wiser. Groundhog Day runs at the Old Vic until 17 September.

Groundhog Day returned to The Old Vic on 20 May 2023 for previews, with an opening night on 8 June 2023, running until 19 August 2023. The original team of Matthew Warchus, Tim Minchin, Danny Rubin and Chris Nightingale reworked the show with a view to a tour and/or West End transfer. Changes included simpler staging (removing the revolves), tightening up the songs and script, and losing a
