The American tradition of Groundhog Day has its roots in the German religious holiday Mariä Lichtmess, also known as Candlemas. Beginning in the 1840s, German immigrants to Pennsylvania had observed the tradition of a hedgehog predicting the end of winter. They adapted the groundhog as replacement meteorologist since there were no hedgehogs in  
The biggest celebration takes place in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania in the United States and its famous little critter Punxsutawney Phil (made famous in the Bill Murray movie about the holiday, called simply Groundhog’s Day).
