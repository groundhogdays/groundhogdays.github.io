Set in Punxsutawney, a real town in Pennsylvania with a famous groundhog named Phil, Groundhog Day was entirely filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. This beloved comedy classic has stood the test of time since its release in 1993. One of the key elements that make the film so memorable is its setting, which plays a crucial role in the plot. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

The film was released on February 12, 1993, grossed $70.9 million worldwide, won the 1994 BAFTA Film Award for Best Original Screenplay and was selected for the United States National Film Registry.

Bill Murray’s memorably excellent 1993 comedy Groundhog Day is an evergreen classic, but it’s gained extra significance under lockdown, with the expression ‘It’s just like ‘Groundhog Day’’ repeated, well, on what seems like a daily basis. For those who haven’t seen the film, the premise revolves around Murray’s character, the  
The 2025 schedule begins Jan. 30 and includes groundhog trivia, a Groundhog Day 5K, a showing of the film, a walking tour of the filming sites, a meet-and-greet with Stephen Tobolowski and more. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Ever since the making of Groundhog Day in 1992, each year Woodstock residents still get together to celebrate Groundhog Day. Woodstock has its own Groundhog Day festival, complete with a dinner dance, free showings of the movie, and a walking tour of some of the sites where the movie was filmed. THE TIP TOP CAFE 
The movie was actually filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. Though the movie premiered quite some time ago, you can still visit Woodstock and find some familiar Groundhog Day locations: most of the buildings still stand and the town proudly displays plaques highlighting where different scenes were filmed. Why was Groundhog Day filmed in Woodstock? 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
The film was not filmed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, but actually in Woodstock, Illinois (just fifty miles from Bill Murray's hometown of Wilmette, Illinois). There is a small plaque that reads "Bill Murray stepped here" on the curb where Murray continually steps into a puddle. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. It stars Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2nd repeatedly.

The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
The movie is basically a comedy, but there’s an underlying dynamic that is a little more thoughtful. Like “Scrooged,” Murray’s dreary 1988 film, this is a movie about a grouch in the process of self-redemption: A supernatural force is showing him his weaknesses. </p>
