        <p>Window of Opportunity: Directed by Peter DeLuise. With Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c realize they and their friends are trapped in a time loop. 
Mallozzi and Mullie later became executive producers of both Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. The episode's unusual story style caused an unexpected shortage of footage during filming, which director Peter DeLuise compensated for by shooting additional scenes, many of which were humorous. "Window of Opportunity" is widely regarded as a fan  
"Window of Opportunity" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of Stargate SG-1. On a routine mission to P4X-639, SG-1 meets an alien archaeologist Malakai operating an Ancient device. Malakai has his own motives and causes a time loop, where only Colonel Jack O'Neill and Teal'c notice. Furthermore, convincing the rest they are trapped in a time loop and that they have to return to the  
SG-1 arrives on P4X-639, an abandoned, desolate world with a blazing hot sun overhead and ancient ruins surrounding the Stargate. They meet Malikai , an alien archaeologist who has been studying the world for many months, first encountered when SG-15 was here two weeks previous. 
Groundhog Day was a popular movie on Earth involving a time loop. While trapped in a time loop by Malakai, Colonel Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was attempting to become the king of Groundhog Day. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity")

Is “Window of Opportunity” the greatest episode of Stargate ever? It’s certainly been a top-ranked favorite episode among fans ever since it first aired on August 4, 2000. Stargate SG-1 co-creator Brad Wright and The Companion are set to celebrate the episode in a special livestream event this Saturday, October 21, at The Companion. The  
The plague will also be revealed to be part of the catalyst for the Ancients relocating to Pegasus come Stargate Atlantis. It's also confirmed the Ancients attempted time-travel experiments and were able to build time-travel technology. This too will become important later down the road in SG-1 and over in Atlantis. 
Stargate SG-1's version of Groundhog Day was thoroughly entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud frequently. Yet this episode was not the comic book that "Upgrades" was. A recurring loop of time is at least more plausible than the superhuman powers experienced by the team in "Upgrades." 
Groundhog Day is a Tau'ri movie about time looping. History. Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was trying to be king of Groundhog Day after activating the Time loop machine. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity") O'Neill asked the ascended Daniel Jackson if he would stop by for Groundhog Day to which Jackson said he couldn't. (SG1: "Abyss")

I've only recently discovered the StarGate SG-1 series and have been working through it. The line "Where have you been all my life" comes to mind. Anyway, this is by far my favorite episode of all. Groundhog day has always been a favorite of mine but this takes it to a new level.

Stargate SG1’s was fantastic, with Col. O’Neill (“with two L’s”) and Teal’c trapped in the time loop. It’s probably my favorite. It’s probably my favorite. Supernatural’s was hilarious, and the one in the Librarians. </p>
