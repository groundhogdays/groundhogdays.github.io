At the party scene at the end of the movie, Phil's piano teacher screams "That's my student!", when Phil plays the piano. This shouldn't be the case as the teacher was paid with a bag of cash Phil stole from the back of the money truck, and the day that let Phil out of the time loop was the day where he only committed virtuous acts. 
Harold Ramis’s 1993 “Groundhog Day,” starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, is a beloved comedy classic.

Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time. In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie.
