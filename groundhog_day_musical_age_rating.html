        <h2><strong>groundhog day musical age rating groundhog day tv guide</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day contains flashing lights, smoke, gun shot effects &amp; some strong language. The story ends happily but has darker phases. One musical sequence in act 2 satirically portrays the central character attempting suicide four times. 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
The story is simple but clever and uses repetition to great effect. Director Harold Ramis also uses sound and music to great comic effect. Phil wakes up every morning at 6 a.m. to the ironically cheery Sonny and Cher song "I Got You Babe." Groundhog Day is a complex, insightful comedy that mostly gets better with each passing year. 
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
Groundhog Day is coming to Australia next year and I have tickets. It was meant to be me and my husband going, but he’s now not able to make the trip - as it’s in the next state down so it’s at least an overnight stay. I have a huge shortage of musical friends irl, and none of them are keen on Groundhog Day, so I’ve tried that option. 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
Broadway Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ The Musical.  Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are  
Groundhog Day was the first musical theatre sheet music book I bought - I figured "If I can play this, I can play anything". I can still only fumble my way through a couple of the songs (Minchin is a musical genius), but I do play through it regularly. 
A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day. Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
Tim Minchin, with too many credits to mention, perfects the music and lyrics for Groundhog Day. Minchin's score, makes a joyful noise, to be sure, but it is not unalloyed hoopla. As one of the shows recurring lines underscores — for all the toe tapping mania — "there's a sense of sadness" (and, I would argue, of substance).

Groundhog Day The Musical is brought to the stage by an award-winning creative team, including composer and lyricist Tim Minchin (Matilda), writer Danny Rubin, and director Matthew Warchus (Matilda, A Christmas Carol). Groundhog Day The Musical most recently played at The Old Vic theatre from 20 May to 19 August 2023.

Matthew Warchus and Danny Rubin have teamed up for an extraordinary production at The Old Vic, with Olivier-award winner Tim Minchkin captivating audiences with his  
Groundhog Day: The Musical review.  In that time, our collective love of the film and the cult of Bill Murray have grown into staples of the internet age, raising the stakes even further. 
Seven years after its premiere, the Groundhog Day musical is back at the Old Vic. Andy Karl is still playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors, condemned to relive a single day over and over. And I still love it. 
Groundhog Day, the Olivier Award-winning new musical featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchinand a book by Danny Rubin, and directed by Matthew Warchus, opens tonight, Monday April 17, on  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop  
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. </p>
