-102- PHIL Groundhog Day, February second, also known as Candlemas Day or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, the day Mary first came to the temple for ritual blessings following the birth of the infant Jesus, and celebrated since the Middle Ages by the sacramental lighting of candles.

I doubt that the producers of the movie ever intended their lighthearted comedy to become a lesson in Buddhist teaching  </p>
