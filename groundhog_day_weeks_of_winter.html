        <p>It's coming up to the point of the winter where a groundhog will tell us whether or not there will be six more weeks of winter.. Groundhog Day is arriving quickly and everyone is waiting to see  
Will we have six more weeks of winter, or won't we?" Put on the map by the 1993 Bill Murray film where a TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, forced to report on the annual celebration time and again, Groundhog Day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year at Gobblers Knob. 
Groundhog Day marks the midpoint of winter, blending European folklore with modern fun as Americans turn to a groundhog’s shadow to predict the season’s outcome — either six more weeks of  
In the American tradition of Groundhog Day, the nation’s groundhog prognosticators take a stance on the season ahead. If the groundhog sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. 
Punxsutawney Phil is the best-known groundhog who has been making predictions since 1886, according to Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. The Groundhog Day tradition as we know it dates to 1887. 
It was not held as a good omen if the day itself was bright and sunny, for that betokened snow and frost to continue to the hiring of the laborers 6 weeks later on Lady Day. If it was cloudy and dark, warmth and rain would thaw the fields and prepare them for planting. Our Groundhog Day is a remote survivor of that belief. 
On Groundhog Day, 2022, Freddie predicted six more weeks of winter, with the mayor of Buckhannon and members of the community in attendance.

Of course, even the organizers of the annual Groundhog Day event in western Pennsylvania acknowledge that turning to a large rodent for weather forecasting is mostly a way to break up winter monotony. 
However, if the groundhog does see his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter rather than above average temperatures, according to legend. Forecast for 7 a.m. Sunday morning in  
Groundhog Club Groundhog Club Vice President Dan McGinley (right) and Dave Gigliotti entertain the crowd while waiting for Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, during the 137th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023.
