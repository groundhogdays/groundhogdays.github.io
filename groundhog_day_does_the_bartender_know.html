        <h2><strong>groundhog day does the bartender know music in groundhog day movie</strong></h2>
        <p>I know I'm years late on this (ironically for Groundhog Day), but just was re-watching.. Yes, the line was cheesy and blatantly silly - but, I think the bartender *is* in on it and is much more important to the story than just a guy pouring drinks. 
He never gives himself up to Phil. By the end of the movie, Phil knows about almost everyone in town but there's no evidence he got to know the bartender. 2. The movie is directed as such as they show the bartender in single shots almost if not every time Phil speaks to him. 
Throughout the film, Phil seems to be the only person in Groundhog Day who knows what he is going to. However, there is a bartender who repeatedly observes Phil, often with a smile. He does this especially when Phil is trying to win over Rita. Was it possible he was suppose to symbplize an angel of sorts? Sent down to make sure Phil would change. 
The bartender, playing the role of the Magical Negro, was the person who caused the infinite time loop— judging by the Knowing Glance towards the camera when Phil finally picks Rita's favorite drink and does her favorite toast. I like the alternative idea that the bartender is also reliving Groundhog Day like Phil, but he just doesn't realize it.

The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication have been meticulously kept. 
Here’s what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It’s a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again.

Phil is stuck in his loop, and finally released from it, by the bartender. As to why he does it, I don't know. Maybe he's a trickster, a Puka like Harvey perhaps. The bartender silently watches Phil. The first night there, Phil is a jerk. He is rude to the bartender. Watch the bartenders eyes, his reaction. 
In the American tradition of Groundhog Day, the nation’s groundhog prognosticators take a stance on the season ahead. If the groundhog sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. </p>
