        <p>Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. 
If Lander Lil "sees" a shadow on Groundhog Day, then more winter is expected. How Punxsutawney Phil fared Overall, 14 of the groundhogs had 50% accuracy or better. 
But over the last 10 years, the groundhog has been correct only two other times: 2020 and 2015, resulting in an accuracy rate of 30%. In fairness to Phil, climatology isn't for the faint of heart. 
NOAA released a study of Groundhog Day predictions and found Punxsutawney Phil to be the 17th most accurate groundhog in the United States. 
Phil's accuracy was just 35% f rom 2005 to 2024, according to data compiled by NOAA.  Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. 
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here&amp;#039;s how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
In the near term, the groundhog’s accuracy rate is slightly worse. According to the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, Phil has been right about 30% of the time over the past decade. ANIMALS OTHER THAN PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL THAT WILL TRY TO PREDICT END OF WINTER ON GROUNDHOG DAY. In 2021, Phil predicted more winter. 
Every Feb. 2, the world's most famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil rises from its burrow in Pennsylvania for Groundhog Day to give the prediction on what type of weather the U.S. could expect to  
Phil’s accuracy issues don’t detract from what Groundhog Day is really about. It’s a massive festival event in Punxsutawney filled with music, celebrations and tourism dollars. 
The people who take care of Phil, members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club’s Inner Circle, however, insist that Phil’s predictions are 100% accurate. The first known record of Groundhog Day  
Here's the forecast for Sunday morning: Cloudy conditions and chilly temperatures in the upper-20s are expected in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania when Phil makes his prediction around 7:08 a.m. ET  
Phil the groundhog has been forecasting the seasons on Groundhog Day at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney since 1887, but just how good is he at his job?  Phil's overall accuracy rate is about 36%  
LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) — As we near the end of January, the next holiday on the list is Groundhog Day or February 2 (which is this Sunday!). Happening this weekend in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania  
In 1979, the Ohio legislature named him the official groundhog for the Buckeye State, per Groundhog-Day.com. How accurate is Phil? How accurate is Chuck? 
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog handler AJ Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, who did not see his shadow, during the 134th annual Groundhog Day festivities on Feb. 2, 2020, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
The Groundhog Day gathering has become a cornerstone event in Punxsutawney, which has marked the occasion every year since mention of the holiday first appeared in 1886 in the local newspaper  
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated every year on February 2? Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition for many as they wait to see how long winter will last. As the legend goes, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it's a forecast of an early spring. 
Which groundhog is more accurate? By the numbers: According to a 2022 study by FiveThirtyEight.com , Beau boasts a 63% accuracy rate for predictions from 2012 to 2021, outshining Phil’s 45.5%. </p>
