Bill Murray stars as a jaded, selfish TV weatherman, who finds himself in a time loop: he’s forced to repeat the same day over and over, while reporting on Groundhog Day festivities. Also with Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and Stephen Tobolowsky. Directed by Harold Ramis. [Running Time: 1:43] 
Replay Groundhog Day with this 15th Anniversary Special Edition DVD release. Bonus materials include A Different Day (an interview with Harold Ramis), The Study of Groundhogs (a real life look at marmots), and The Weight of Time (a making-of documentary). 
Although GROUNDHOG DAY emphasizes that man desires not to be accountable for his deeds, it falsely implies that man can save himself from his sinful propensities. Even so, the film is humorous, lighthearted and fun though somewhat redundant. Thus, a discerning viewer will come out ahead as he learns “There is nothing new under the sun.” 
For a 90's PG movie the language is exceptionally mild and soft. The comedic suicide scenes are meant to prove a lesson to the main character. They are comedic and exaggerated and actually have an anti-suicide message in that the main character has to re-live Groundhog Day until he becomes a nicer, more decent person.

“Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold Ramis, Murray’s fellow Ghostbuster and a partner from their Second City days. The film is lovable and sweet. The film is lovable and sweet. If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
Neutral —“Groundhog Day” is a movie which I thoroughly enjoyed in the years before I had become a more discerning believer, and it is strange now to view it from a Biblical perspective. I watched it recently for the first time in years, and found myself still enjoying it on one level (its sheer humor and entertainment value) while  
When the Bill Murray comedy Groundhog Day was released nearly 30 years ago, it wasn’t considered a classic. The critics liked it but didn’t love it. Moviegoers made it a moderate success. It did just fine. But just like Phil Connors’ endless Feb. 2, the movie never really went away. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature.

107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
Parents need to know that, as romantic comedies go, the holiday-flavored 12 Dates of Christmas is quite tame. There's no sexual content to speak of (a couple of kisses is as strong as it gets) and only a smattering of swearing ("damn," "bitch," "pissed"), so it's a viable option for older tweens. 
Do you ever have deja vu? Didn't you just ask me that? Bill Murray is at his wry, wisecracking best in this riotous romantic comedy about a weatherman caught in a personal time warp on the worst day of his life. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney

Groundhog Day might have been a mere gimmick movie, but it isn't; it's something better -- a gentle fantasy of both paralysis and liberation. Full Review | Dec 21, 2022 Gary Wolcott Tri-City Herald
