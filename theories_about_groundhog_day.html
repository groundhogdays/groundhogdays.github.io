        <h2><strong>theories about groundhog day what the groundhog day saying</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day as economic theory. Thinkstock. In 2006, economist D. W. MacKenzie published an article on “The Economics of Groundhog Day,” noting that the movie “illustrates the importance  
The Metaphysics of Groundhog Day Lawrence Crocker says it’s about time, and personal identity, and free will. The 1993 movie Groundhog Day was, of course, made as an exploration of the metaphysics of time. The basic idea is that for on-location TV weatherman Phil Connors, the same Groundhog Day, February 2, in Punxsutawney keeps repeating. 
The director Harold Ramis didn't intend for his movie Groundhog Day to be heralded by religious thinkers as an example of how to live life, but that's exactly what happened after it was released  
In Groundhog Day (1993), Murray’s character, Phil Connors, finds that no matter what he does, every morning he wakes up at the same time, in the same bed, in the same hotel, in the same small American town, on the same day (February 2nd, ‘Groundhog Day’). In the subsequent twenty-four hours he is free to do anything he likes, but knows he  
Because we are all living the same day over and over again. There’s variance here and there, but each day is a chance, a blank slate, from which to work. The macro’s in the minutiae. Every day we have the same conversations with loved ones. Every day we make dinner, go to work, exercise, read. Or perhaps we don’t. 
So being forced to live a day over and over is indeed a rare way to gain some perspective on our daily lives, [4] and Groundhog Day’s suggestion, together with Aristotle, is that exercising the virtues leads to happiness because it develops our best potential, our true nature, our path to flourishing and to achieving, realizing, perfecting  
Yet Groundhog Day remains the quintessential time-loop film, to the point where its name is now synonymous with the genre.  The popular moral theory of utilitarianism, which conceives ethical  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
meanings of the film. One theory in particular looks at Groundhog Day from an economic perspective. Economist D.W. MacKenzie presented the argument 11 years after the release of the film that Groundhog Day is an excellent display of monetary theory, giving a visual example of a hypothetical concept of economic ‘perfection.’ 
Groundhog Day illustrates the weakness of existentialist theories about happiness and the meaning of life, namely, all you end up with is a subjective assessment of your life – a psychological selfie. “Passing” a psychological test about how we feel about our lives is not, however, sufficient for living a life that is truly, or  
Here’s what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It’s a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again. 
My sister and I annually watch this movie on Grounds Hogs day, and we always think that the bartender is in on it. My theory is that Phil is a looper, but I believe that the Bartender is someone who is aware of the loops, and is able to tell every time a loop occurs in which Phil interacts with him, hence the smirk. 
Groundhog Day is one of my family's Thanksgiving movies (along with Charlie Brown and The Wiz, for whatever reason), so I was thinking about some of the theories associated with the movie, like how he's been living the same day for thousands of years, or how the bartender is a guardian angel type and is coherent while he's reliving those days. 
Darn, I had a similar theory I was waiting to post on Groundhog Day. Oh well, here's my addendum: Phil's actions do not let him escape the time loop. Every timeline in which he survives continues, and in all of those a version of Phil wakes up the next day thinking he's broken free. 
That becomes one of Groundhog Day's best running jokes as Ned pops up again and again at the same point in time, eager as a puppy and cheerfully shrugging off whatever new means Phil has devised of dismissing him. Under the new theory, however, that first step into the puddle becomes the moment the time loop starts. 
Groundhog Day never really ends, it’s a parasite that gets passed from person to person. That’s my theory. Let Me explain: There’s a theory on reddit that Phil Connors is in hell/purgatory and that Ned Ryerson is/was the devil (need link). This video covers that idea but doesn’t link the post. I remember reading it years ago here too. 
One of the most interesting theories about Groundhog Day actually repaints the movie's ending as far less happy than it otherwise seems. Harold Ramis' 1993 comedy classic Groundhog Day popularized a strangely specific and interesting concept: the use of a time loop as the basis for a romantic comedy. 
While the "Groundhog Day" theory certainly has some validity, it nevertheless has its fair share of detractors. Given the ambiguous nature of the film's timeline, some fans such as u/831pm aren't  
Phil had to overcome the seven deadly sins in order to escape the time loop.Almost all of the seven deadly sins make an appearance in the movie. Think about it: Sloth: Sitting around in a bathrobe watching game shows till he has them memorized.
