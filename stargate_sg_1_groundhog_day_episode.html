        <p>Window of Opportunity: Directed by Peter DeLuise. With Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c realize they and their friends are trapped in a time loop. 
"Window of Opportunity" is the sixth episode from season 4 of the science fiction television series Stargate SG-1, and first aired on the American subscription channel Showtime on August 4, 2000. The episode is based on a time loop scenario, with SG-1 team members Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c repeatedly reliving the same ten hours after a mission

As they do this repeatedly, Teal'c and O'Neill are able to accumulate more information, eventually leading them to understand that an archaeologist, Malakai, has inadvertently created a time loop using

On P4X-639, SG-1 meets Malikai, an explorer from another world studying the planet's ruins, including an ancient alien computer that seems to hold the key to the planet's mysteries. The computer draws its power from geomagnetic storms caused by increased solar activity, and as Malikai begins to activate the device, O'Neill and Teal'c are caught

I've only recently discovered the StarGate SG-1 series and have been working through it. The line "Where have you been all my life" comes to mind. Anyway, this is by far my favorite episode of all. Groundhog day has always been a favorite of mine but this takes it to a new level. 
There’s no doubt that “Window of Opportunity” is one of the most beloved episodes of Stargate SG-1. The fourth season episode mixes heart and camaraderie with some of the show’s funniest moments.
