Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
He just wants to get the work done and go home like he does every day of his life. 1. INCITING INCIDENT. At Gobbler’s Knob, the groundhog “Phil” sees a shadow and “predicts” that the winter will last six more weeks. People are depressed, but Phil doesn’t care, he just wants to leave immediately.
