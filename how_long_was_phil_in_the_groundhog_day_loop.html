        <p>Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Director Harold Ramis believed Phil Connors was trapped for 10-40 years, adding weight to his loathing of the curse. Initially, the script envisioned a 10,000 year time-loop, but was reduced to  
One Writer Finally Deciphers The Groundhog Day Timeline. On February 2, 2011, former editor and COO of WhatCulture, Simon Gallagher, wrote a more in-depth article analyzing Groundhog Day’s events and pieced together his own timeline. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
Widely considered to be one of the best comedy movies of all time, "Groundhog Day's" story of weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) struggling to break free from living the same 24-hour period  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395 times. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
I've always wondered what caused the Time Loop experienced by Phil Connors in Groundhog Day, as well as what ended it, but I don't recall it being discussed in the movie. 
2 February is Groundhog Day – when, according to Punxsutawney folklore, a groundhog called Punxsutawney Phil predicts the arrival of spring. The tradition spawned the 1993 comedy classic that saw Bill Murray's sardonic TV weatherman Phil Connors stuck in the same day over and over again. 
In relationship to the spiritual interpretations of the films, many have tried to estimate how long Phil supposedly remains trapped in the loop, in real time, with a wide variance in estimated values. During filming, Ramis, who was a Buddhist, observed that according to Buddhist doctrine, it takes 10,000 years for a soul to evolve to its next  
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  
I've several times wondered for how long was Phil Connors stuck in that loop. There are the on-screen shown days which I estimate around 40. But then, Phil learns lot of stuff about the people of the town, he learns French poetry, piano, ice sculpting, etc. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop. Related: Groundhog Day’s Best Theory Makes The Happy Ending A Curse 
Death has, after all, meant little to Phil over the course of the film. There are different theories about how long Phil spends in his cycle, from a few years (long enough to learn French, ice sculpture, auto repair and a few musical instruments) to 10,000 years — that’s the figure cited by director and co-writer Harold Ramis and mentioned by Connors himself in one draft of the script. 
I'd like to tie it into 12:01 but Phil is clearly in the loop for years, whereas 12:01 (the full length movie) has a couple of dozen iterations at most, and the short story has a 1 hour time loop. Reply reply
