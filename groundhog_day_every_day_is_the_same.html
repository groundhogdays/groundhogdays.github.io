        <p>To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently.

It was proclaimed by the “Punxsutawney Groundhog Club” in 1887, the same year they declared Punxsutawney to be the weather capital of the world. Every February 2, the “faithful followers of Phil” can await his arrival starting at 6 a.m., thanks to a livestream provided by Visit Pennsylvania. 
Put on the map by the 1993 Bill Murray film where a TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, forced to report on the annual celebration time and again, Groundhog Day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year at Gobblers Knob. 
Or when then-Cleveland Cavalier Antawn Jamison said of the team's losing ways in 2011, "It's like Groundhog Day, every day," he helped spawn the go-to metaphor for futility in sports, with the L.A  
The first official Groundhog Day took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event took up permanent residence at Gobbler’s Knob the following year. 
One of my favorite movies is “Groundhog Day” (1993), featuring Bill Murray as a self-involved television weatherman on location to film the groundhog coming out of his hole on Feb. 2. 
Every Feb. 2 millions can't help but wait and see if a groundhog, most specifically Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow or not which in turn determines winter's extension or spring's early arrival. 
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day (Pennsylvania German: Grund'sau dåk, Grundsaudaag, Grundsow Dawg, Murmeltiertag; Nova Scotia: Daks Day) [1] [2] [3] is a tradition observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year. 
Homage to the movie Groundhog Day from 1993!Eine Hommage an den Film "Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier" von 1993!Movie info:  
Countless celebrities swear by the so-called “Groundhog Day diet.” It’s a pretty simple concept: eat the same dish every day. Not necessarily for the same meal each day, let alone for every meal. 
As February rapidly approaches, so, too, does a popular “holiday” that occurs every year on February 2nd: Groundhog Day. As the folklore dictates, Groundhog Day stems from a Christian tradition called Candlemas. Each year, at the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, churches would distribute candles to help people survive the remaining [] 
If you wake up every morning feeling like it’s Groundhog Day and all your days are starting to blend together-- you are not alone.In this video, I’m sharing  
While Groundhog Day isn't a federal holiday in the United States, the traditional observance celebrates the triumph of spring over winter. Groundhog Day is celebrated every year on Feb. 2. This  
I was recently telling to my sister how bad of a depression rut I'm going through (again) and used Groundhog Day as a comparison. Every day is the same ,nobody knows what you're going through and it can be maddening. Not at all amusing or entertaining like Bill Murray's Groundhog Day was. 
When you look at Woodstock's town square today, it looks almost the same as when the movie "Groundhog Day" was being shot. Except there are now more businesses open than back in 1992. 
Groundhog Day falls on a Sunday this year, which makes for a perfect day to relax with loved ones and put on a nostalgic movie: "Groundhog Day", starring Bill Murray. "Groundhog Day" begs the  
The Groundhog Day Diet: Why I Eat the Same Thing Every Day For the past five years, I’ve eaten pretty much the same thing every single day. Every morning for the last 1,825 some odd days, I’ve eaten an egg scramble (1 whole egg + 8 ounces of egg whites) + 1 oz of cheddar cheese + 2 Xtreme Wellness High Fiber Low Carb Tortilla Wraps. 
Groundhog Day is more than just a comedy—it's a timeless tale of redemption and self-discovery. Join Bill Murray as he relives the same day endlessly, findin </p>
