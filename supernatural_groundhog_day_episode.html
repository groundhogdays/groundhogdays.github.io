        <h2><strong>supernatural groundhog day episode groundhog day writing prompt</strong></h2>
        <p>Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
Sam and Dean investigate a mysterious disappearance at a tourist trap in Florida, where Dean dies every Tuesday in a time loop. Sam tries to break the loop and save his brother from the Trickster, who is behind the prank. 
Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). They hunt evil creatures and other supernatural foes, with the first season focusing on their

When Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who was looking into a tourist attraction known as "The Mystery Spot" -- where the laws of physics don't apply -- Sam is thrown into a repeating loop, living the same day over and over, and watching Dean die each time in a different way as Sam avoids the method that killed him the last time.

A Supernatural season 3 episode can explain a plot hole in the season 15 finale. Sam and Dean Winchester have always brought each other back, or at least tried to. It all started with John Winchester when he traded his soul for Dean’s in season 2, “In My Time of Dying.” 
For this episode = Dean dies at least 102 times, but only in the Trickster's reality. For the series so far = At least 236 humans (of which 3 were witches), 17 ghosts, 9 demons, 10 vampires, 6 changelings, 3 gods, 2 shapeshifters, 2 werewolves, 1 djinn, 1 rakshasa, 1 rawhead, 1 shtriga, 1 wendigo, and 1 zombie. 
Long story short, I ended up watching “Mystery Spot” before most other episodes of the show because it happened to be on TV one night and I was fully hooked. The episode, which finds Sam stuck in a Groundhog Day-style time loop that resets after Dean dies, was a brilliant mixture of comedy, angst, and poignancy. By that point in the season

Another one of the Trickster's ploys, Sam is forced to watch Dean perish over and over again as he relives the same day and fails to save his brother time and again. 
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah
