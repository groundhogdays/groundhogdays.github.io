In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie. Poor Phil Connors (played with excellent drollness by Bill Murray) was forced to wake up day after day, reliving each run-in with Needlenose Ned, his producer Rita, and his cameraman, Larry. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone.

Best Groundhog Day Quotes. "Phil: Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster? Mrs. Lancaster: I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen." - Phil Connors 
The Groundhog Day Alarm Clock consists of a Panasonic RC-6025 flip clock modified to play the audio from the movie Groundhog Day when the alarm goes off. The reason I have created this device is because Groundhog Day (both the day and film) held special meaning for me because I first met my ex-partner-in-crime on February 2nd. 
But Groundhog Day is such a clever, wonderful ride that you don't notice the joins. It's rare for a comedy to be funny and profound but also popular. Films such as Groundhog Day and Back to the Future sold a lot of popcorn, but they were insanely smart too. That's very inspiring when you're sitting there trying to write a comedy screenplay. 
Good morning, campers! It's Groundhog Day again. Stay warm, and we hope you find love and the meaning of life. #groundhogday #sixmoreweeksofwinter 
Groundhog Day Trivia 1. How Many Groundhog Days Does Conners Actually Repeat? If you are wondering about exacts, the film depicts 38 separate Groundhog Days but the best guess about actual time that passes is around 30 to 40 years, per Ramis. Some people guesstimate thousands of years and equaled it to something like purgatory.
