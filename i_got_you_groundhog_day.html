A scene from Groundhog Day featuring the song "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere.

The movie grew a cult of fans that watched it every February 2, giving it a foothold in the popular culture. By association, "I Got You Babe" became part of the groundhog day tradition. In 2020, Bill Murray appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for the Jeep Gladiator where the song plays throughout. In the spot, he re-creates the film, but this  
The script for Groundhog Day was adjusted between Danny Rubin’s first pass and Ramis’s revisions; originally, Phil was supposed to be stuck in his repetitive hell for 10,000 years.

At first, Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray’s sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity.
