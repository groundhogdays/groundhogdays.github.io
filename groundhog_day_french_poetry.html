        <p>The pronunciation is mostly wrong and the words are mumbled. Maybe it sounds French enough to fool the director and the producers of the movie But not me. P. P.-S. And it’s not old French poetry, the poem is inspired by the song La bourrée du célibataire by Jacques Brel (translated as Bachelor’s Dance). « La fille que j’aimera » is  
Groundhog Day refers to the yin/yang cycle (at the heart of the Zodiac) that mankind has endured for hundreds of thousands of years (aka glaciation cycle). Koyaanisqatsi reveals that when sped up, you can see how mankind’s multi-millennial day becomes perceptible as a day of mere hours. 
Bill Murray 
Rita: "Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry."Phil: "What a waste of time!" 
- Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. - La fille qui j'aimerai sera comme bon vin qui se bonifiera un peu chaque matin. - You speak French! - Oui. - I haven't done this since I was a kid. - Me neither. It's fun! - It's good, clean fun. - I hope that one day I can do this with my own children. - Where'd you get that? 
Believe it or not, I studied 19th-century French poetry. You speak French! I haven't done this since I was a kid. Me neither. It's fun! Clean fun. I hope one day I can do this with my own children. Where'd you get that? Well, I went over to the snowman shop. Hey, an assassin! I'll protect you! I shall die for you. You shall not take her! Find  
The poem Phil quoted to Rita was actually not 16th-century French poetry, but rather a song by Jacques Brel called La bourrée du célibataire (Bachelor's Dance). I had trouble finding translated lyrics, other than this from wikipedia: "The girl I will love is like a fine wine that gets a little better every morning." 
My favourite part: Rita (Andie MacDowell) tells Phil (Bill Murray) that she studied 19th-century French poetry. The first time she says it, he laughs at her -- "Really? What a waste of time." -- and she recoils, not a little disgusted with his philistinism. 
The French poetry, which at first he can’t stop himself from [laughs] from laughing out loud Wes: Yeah. Erin: over Rita’s study of 19th century french poetry in which, in the iteration after that, he quotes some sort of fake french poetry to her the following day.

The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
“RITA:” Hmm-mmm. Believe it or not, I studied 19th century French poetry. “PHIL:” (recites a French poem). “RITA:” You speak French. “PHIL:” Oui. “Phil’s Encounters With Ned Ryerson:” “Day 1:” * “NED:” Do you have life insurance? Because if you do, you could always use a little more. Am I right or am I right or am  
OF COURSE I do not own this. Just thought it was cool. 
Groundhog Day (1993) Bill Murray as Phil.  You're a sucker for French poetry and rhinestones. You're very generous. You're kind to strangers and children, and when  
RITA: Believe it or not, I studied 19th Century French poetry. Phil's first reaction is to think poetry is a total waste of time. But after he realizes this response won't win Rita over, he goes out and learns how to speak French just to impress her. Rita is no fool though. She eventually sees through Phil's attempts to get her into bed with him.
