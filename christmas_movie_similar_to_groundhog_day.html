        <p>Why you'll like this movie: Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
The classic 1993 movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a surly weatherman sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the tiny town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil (who openly

While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life. 
Bill Murray repeating the same day over and over is certainly unique, but here are 12 movies like "Groundhog Day" we think you should check out. 
Some dabble with the idea of goodwill toward men, others not at all, but every year you’ll likely see at least a few in the post-Christmas day TV listings. Santa won’t be climbing down any chimneys here (well, not without swearing). 1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. 
Premiering only a few months after the release of Groundhog Day, this TV movie is a feature-length version of the much darker Oscar nominee, which was titled 12:01 PM (watch it on YouTube). Both  
Harold Ramis’ 1993 classic Groundhog Day is simply one of the most perfect movies ever made; Bill Murray’s snarky sense-of-humor has never been more endearing, and Ramis’ script is both  
Movies like groundhog day .  Christmas Every Day (1996) Christmas Do-Over (2006)  not about life lessons like Groundhog Day Reply reply 
Read More: Movies Like Source Code. 6. Happy Death Day (2017) Much like ‘Triangle’, ‘Happy Death Day’ feels like a breeze and is pretty effective with its running time. Tree Glebman is Jess in this scenario, but while the latter functioned amidst a bleaker tone, the former revels in a more darkly comic and absurdist backdrop.

The first time I saw "Groundhog Day" I was reminded of a short film called "1201 pm" that I'd seen late one night when I was a teenager. It stars Kurtwood Smith.
