If your day resets every time you go to bed, do you have a obligation to behave morally? I would think if you knew someone was going to fall out of a tree and you could save that person through little effort, you have a moral obligation to do so. But that rests tentatively on the fact that human life has value and is precious. 
To illustrate this, Groundhog Day offers a montage of some of his good deeds, the funniest of which is that he times it perfectly to catch a kid who falls out of a tall tree. Not that the kid is ever grateful: “You little brat,” Phil yells as the boy runs off, “you have never thanked me!” 
Rita asks him out for coffee, but he declines, citing some errands. Phil proceeds to save a child falling from a tree, fix a flat tire for three elderly ladies, save a man from choking, and play the piano incredibly at the Groundhog Day party. When Rita arrives at the party, she is charmed to see Phil playing the piano. 
He saves a kid falling out of a tree, nurses an old homeless man back to health, performs the Heimlich maneuver on the choking Buster Green, and over the course of one day manages to help pretty much everyone in town. 
In Groundhog Day, the classic 1993 comedy about a self-centered weatherman (Bill Murray)  He learns new skills like ice sculpting, saves a kid falling out of a tree, and preoccupies himself  
Honestly, it must be in the 100's. To memorize even one interaction would take so many repeated occurrences. Its like in Day after Tomorrow, there's a scene when Tom basically closes his eyes and fights two drunk army dudes. How many times would you have to go through that 2 min interact

Well it was a bit tricky with groundhog day so I had to watch it many times over in order to figure it out. Trust me after you watch groundhog day for the 6th time in one weekend you feel like your head is spinning.

Groundhog Day is a quirky and fun holiday that gets kids excited about the changing seasons and the famous tradition of predicting the weather. Whether the groundhog sees its shadow or not, you can keep the fun going with Groundhog Day coloring pages for kids. 
Allegedly Optimistic Ending: In the BFI Modern Classics edition of Groundhog Day, the author notes the film ends with "Almost Like Being in Love" and Phil making a half-measure of renting a place in Punxsutawney instead of outright moving there,  </p>
