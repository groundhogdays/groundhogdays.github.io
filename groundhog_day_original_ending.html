Well, Groundhog Day, the award-winning 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis, captures that feeling perfectly, but it initially had a very different ending. The critically acclaimed film sees Phil Connors ( Bill Murray ) — a weatherman from Pennsylvania who gets stuck in a never-ending time loop on Groundhog Day. 
What I never realized until today is that Rubin’s original concept  Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist  
Groundhog Day's enduring legacy is due to its genius use of a ruthless premise to trigger organic change within a despicable man.; The original script for Groundhog Day was much more cynical and  
While I think Groundhog Day made the right changes, this ending sounds like a really fun way to mirror the original opening and voiceover. Also, it's interesting to note the similarities to Palm Springs , which uses a similar dynamic as the driving for the movie. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

Film classic Groundhog Day was due to have an alternative ending — and it would have been one hell of a corker. The award-winning 1993 film starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita could have had a very exciting twist according to screenwriter Danny Rubin. 
Perhaps the biggest change to the original draft was the removal of a twist ending that, on paper, feels much eerier than what ended up on the screen.  The original draft of ‘Groundhog Day  
The original ending to the movie had a plot twistand I'm glad that they didn't do it. We all LOVE the movie Groundhog Day especially on February 2nd. The original  
Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, has become a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences to this day. The movie follows the story of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, a cynical weatherman who finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again.

I don't think Groundhog day should be mucked with. Really, sometimes you really nail something and you should leave it the fuck alone. I mean reading that article what I was thinking was, 'Well maybe the writer got the script 90% there and Ramis's instinct on his changes got it the rest of the way'.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day's enduring legacy is due to its genius use of a ruthless premise to trigger organic change within a despicable man.; The original script for Groundhog Day was much more cynical and  
The award-winning, critically-acclaimed 1993 film Groundhog Day, starring the one and only Bill F*cking Murray, is one of the best films ever made.That’s just a fact, but the beloved film’s original ending was not at all the happy ending we all know and love, according to an article on UNILAD. 
Scenes present in the finished film happened much earlier in Rubin's script such as Phil driving over a cliff happening in the first loop. The passage of time was also more distinct; Phil would track this by reading a page of a book per day, reaching his low point when he realizes he has run out of books. The ending also featured a twist. 
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
Groundhog Day was nearly a $3 million independent movie. And a much darker one, with a big twist ending Skip to main content area  is enjoyed just as much today as it was on its original  </p>
