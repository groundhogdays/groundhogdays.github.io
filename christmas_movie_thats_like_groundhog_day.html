        <h2><strong>christmas movie thats like groundhog day is today groundhog day 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Why you'll like this movie: Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life.

After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you.

50 First Dates. Adam Sandler tends to be tolerable when paired with Drew Barrymore, and this is actually a pretty sweet rom-com that’s sort of Groundhog Day meets Truman Show (and maybe a little  
Some dabble with the idea of goodwill toward men, others not at all, but every year you’ll likely see at least a few in the post-Christmas day TV listings. Santa won’t be climbing down any chimneys here (well, not without swearing). 1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day.
