The beginning of Harry's day was routine, meet Luna, get breakfast, scare the hell out of Ron and Hermione with his odd behavior. After that, Harry broke routine by going to class. "Today," Snape loomed over the first row. "I am going to attempt to drill into your thick skulls . . ." "Shut up you dirty bag of dragon droppings," Harry called out. 
The next time Dumbledore gave the Groundhog Day potion to Harry, he made sure that Ron did not interfere. Of course, things were thrown into chaos when Luna Lovegood accidentally drank some of the potion, on Harry's 200th day of the cycle, but that's another story. 
He watched Potter and Weasley walk down the steps with their dates. Weasley went into the hall and left Potter with his date outside. Granger arrived at the top of the steps, at first she glanced around timidly before appearing fully. Draco watched her face as she started descending the stairs, she caught Potterâ€™s eye and gave a small timid

Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, this is just for entertainment purposes. Besides I would not be able to make money off this as I am not that good of a writer. So for gods sake do sue. "Groundhog Day at Hogwarts" February 2 
Also, there's Wastelands of Time, plus HP &amp; the Temporal Beacon, both of which involve a "groundhog day" like time loop. The former is Harry/Fleur and complete, the latter is H/Hr and abandoned, IIRC. Sorry I have no links, I'm on mobile atm.

Not really a Groundhog Day story. To me, it is yet another DLP-bait, Harry-Potter-is-Wolverine fic. He drinks, he smokes, he fucks, he takes massive damage but gets better. The usual. It doesn't read like a Harry Potter story, more like the massive genre crossover it all but admits to in the author's initial blurb chapter. 
Notes: This piece takes place in a Harry Potter 'reality' where entities which are assumed will be eventually responsible for the events of Groundhog Day in a different reality are messing around with one particular Harry Potter universe character. 
A/N: This is inspired by the old film 'Groundhog Day' â€“ if you haven't seen it, a man gets stuck in a time loop, repeating one day over and over. He eventually re-evaluates his life and changes his ways, so he can break the loop he's stuck in. The basic concept is applied here, I have got poor Draco stuck in his time loop. Groundhog Day  
Not Harry Potter, the movie Groundhog Day, nor anything else that might pop up in this story. Mine are only the spelling errors. Author's Note: The following is set in sixth year. It is completely Ron/Hermione, if you haven't already guessed. Maybe some H/G later on. I hope it's not too stereotypical. 
Harry finds himself repeating the Day of the Yule Ball over and over, and he's the only one that remembers it. This may take a while to figure out, so he might as well enjoy the Ball, right?

She had her eyes on him since first year, much as Draco had. But Draco was realistic and knew that he would be lucky to meet a man, as half as decent, as Potter. Potter was straight, Potter was the saviour, Potter was the exact opposite to Draco in every way. Opposing houses, opposing sides in the war, and even opposing sexuality.

Yet, Potter wouldn't remember all the hard work and effort Draco had put in. Today he had enough, he waited until Potter once again escaped the common room to hide from Weaslette. Potter was sat in a huge window seat, looking out the window at the sky. Draco stopped in front of him and coughed to make Harry aware that he was there. 
In early 1993, the Bill Murray masterpiece Groundhog Day came out- the story of a man forced to relive the same day over and over again until he got things right. Unfortunately, for Harry, getting things right was easier said than done. </p>
