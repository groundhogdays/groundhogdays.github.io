Groundhog Day, though simple and light-hearted on the surface, is riven with philosophical insight. Phil is not only wrestling with Nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence, he’s also playing out the Jungian concept of the shadow. It’s no coincidence that the groundhog’s called Phil too.

For Phil, the nasty, self-centered weather forecaster played by Bill Murray in “Groundhog Day,” that hell reveals itself one morning in the Groundhog Capitol of Punxsutawney, Pa. He has journeyed there to do a remote broadcast about his namesake, the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil, who every year informs the nation whether it will have six

Save the Cat Analysis . Opening Image (p. 1) – Opening image: a blue sky with clouds moving across it, and “marching band” type music. The clouds moving potentially foreshadows the unrest in the heavens that results in Groundhog Day actually occurring, but this doesn’t really feel like a counter-balance to the finale.
