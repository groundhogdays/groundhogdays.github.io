Groundhog Day 2023: Phil predicts 6 more weeks of winter Connors goes to bed that night, and awakens the next morning trapped in a pesky time loop. Over and over he lives out the same day — binge eating, causing chaos and getting to know his charming producer Rita Hanson, played by Andie MacDowell.

A plot in which the character is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of time (often exactly one day) over and over, until something is corrected.
