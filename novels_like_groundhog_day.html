        <h2><strong>novels like groundhog day how many more days until groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Just in time for Groundhog’s Day (the holiday), we have a list of great time loop novels like Groundhog’s Day (the movie)! Just kidding! If you’re familiar with the 1993 film, you know that reporter Bill Murray gets stuck in a small town covering the news about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who may or may not see his shadow. 
In a Holidaze by Christina Lauren – The book that inspired this list! I enjoyed the advanced ebook I received so much, I ordered the book in paperback. I’m eager to reread it this holiday season. Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver – One of the first time loop books I remember reading, this one blew me away. I still find myself thinking about it.

Groundhog Day, Happy Death Day, and Palm Springs are just a few examples of this trope. TV is no different, with Supernatural, Russian Doll, and other shows devoting an episode or an entire series to the concept of repeating a day. You know how it goes: a character wakes up, usually to a radio playing a song or the ring of a phone. 
A murder mystery novel inspired by Agatha Christie with a dash of Groundhog Day and a hint of Quantum Leap and Downton Abbey. If that doesn’t make you want to read The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton, then maybe this will. Aiden Bishop knows the rules. 
Quote from wikipedia "Harold Ramis, who directed Groundhog Day, found the meaning of Strange Life of Ivan Osokin similar to the existential dilemma of Groundhog Day. Both works imply that a sober acceptance of personal accountability is necessary in order to effect an increase in the degree of freedom of the individual. 
2. "4 3 2 1" by Paul Auster. 4 3 2 1 tells the stories of young Archie Ferguson growing up in the 1950s and ’60s. Notice the plural stories: the entire book hinges on a ‘what if’ moment, where the plot splits into four possible lives Archie might go on to live. 
Winner of 2020’s Best Fiction Novel by the GoodReads community with over a million ratings on the app, The Midnight Library takes a fresh twist on the time loop trope: rather than reliving a single day, Nora Seed continuously relives her life in all the ways it could have been. Only accessible on the precipice of death, the Midnight Library  
The Third Policeman is a novel by Irish writer Brian O'Nolan, writing under the pseudonym Flann O'Brien. It was written between 1939 and 1940, but after it initially failed to find a publisher, the author withdrew the manuscript from circulation and claimed he had lost it. 
It's been years since I read this book. It was interesting but I thought it was a bit odd. I read book 2 Hollow City as well, but I haven't kept up with the series. I don't remember a lot about the book, but the children at Miss Peregrine's home are reliving a day during WWII. This has allowed them to live a long life, except they never grow up. 
What is a time loop book? Think of it as a story that repeats itself over and over, much like the famed movie, Groundhog Day. It can also be a book that starts and finishes on the same day without necessarily doing multiple repeats. These stories can be loads of fun or utterly flop. The trick is in the scenarios the writer is conveying.

I love this trope so much. Even when the writing is poor or the plot doesn’t make much sense, I always enjoy the book or movie. I have found a bunch of movies that have this plot (Groundhog Day, Palm Springs, The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, ARQ, The Edge of Tomorrow, etc.) but I have had a bit harder time with books. 
Sweet, watercolor illustrations on a white background add to the book’s clean, simple nature. The text has some repetition among the words, but the inclusion of a few contractions may make it difficult for some readers. New readers in grades K-2, especially animal lovers, will enjoy learning about Groundhog Day from this short informational book.

Director Venkat Prabhu knows his influences, from the framework of Groundhog Day to the Rashomon-like plot device of Vantage Point. It all seeps through in every frame. And yet, Prabhu uses all of these elements to speak about themes like Islamophobia, police brutality, and class divide.

It is becoming clearer and clearer that Groundhog Day (1993), directed by Harold Ramis, is one of the masterpieces of 1990s Hollywood cinema.One of the first films to use a science-fiction premise as the basis for romantic comedy, it tells the story of a splenetic TV weatherman, Phil Connors (Bill Murray at his disreputable best), who finds himself indefinitely repeating one drab day in  </p>
