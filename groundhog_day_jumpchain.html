        <p>For some reason, I just really like Jumps based on little settings like this. Things like It's a Wonderful Life, Back to the Future, True Lies, Die Another Day, Dark Crystal, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Labyrinth, and such. Like the older 80's/90's/early 2000's movies. Probably because that's what I grew up with. 
Chunin Exam Day JumpChain The Endless Day - 800 CP  Movies Like Groundhog Day; Top Posts Reddit . reReddit: Top posts of September 16, 2022. Reddit . 
A pet groundhog that can trap people in a time loop until they learn some valuable life lesson. A truck that can unexplode itself. The town the story takes place in. A piece of jewelry that can be given to someone else that will que them in on the time loop as long as they’re wearing it. Or maybe just makes them immune to time related  
Brothel (200cp): A very profitable brothel of your very own. You have a good relationship with the madam (who handles the day to day operation) and many of the prostitutes. The brothel is never looked into by law enforcement for some reason. 
so 6-7 jumps (not doing Guantlet, and my not do Chunnin Exam Day) a little short for a chain, but it's a fun theme. acheld said: TIL that there isn't a Groundhog Day jumpchain.

The Jumpchain series of CYOAs was begun by an Anon named Quicksilver from /tg/. It has grown enormously over time now with hundreds of separate cyoa's all designed to link together. Here's the set up: You are contacted by an omnipotent entity. a dangerously bored omnipotent entity. 
Think Harry Potter, but Groundhog Day. There's a month-long time-loop going on, so if you rule people's skills and attributes and stuff resetting with the loop unless they're a looper, in which case they get to keep them -- that's what I would rule -- then you ensure that only yourself and other loopers will see improvements. 
Groundhog Day(1993) I'd be going to lotr and wreck the orcs as a tamaranean kryptomartian. With the 800 CP true alien, I'd probably behave like a stereotypical tamaranean. 
Meaning your unable to be rewritten out of history, zero-summed or paradoxed out by having your parent killed before your born, you're fully capable of surviving the cause of your existence being erased. have your timeline altered by outside forces, have your aged, de-aged, frozen in time, slowed down in time or be caught in time/ groundhog day

The series really feels like something jumpchain would be all over by now. there's an in-universe leveling system and they already basically have roles for heroes and villains. tons of crazy 4th wall breaks (If someone said that holo jane actually was a jumper chilling in the KO world i'd believe it) 
The former basically starts off as Groundhog Day with Joffrey, whilst the latter is an SI of an American farmer with no knowledge whatsoever of ASOIAF. I should note that Purple Days starts of a little rocky and you can basically skip the first chapter, but it ends up becoming genuine novel quality as it goes on (Seriously – there are actual  
There’s also the Leprechaun, for instance, like from Saint Patrick’s Day, likely representing good fortune. The Groundhog, like from Groundhog Day, is also mentioned, probably representing weather? foresight? Point is, there are more spirits in the world than just those that appear on-screen, and so if you want, you can become one of them.
