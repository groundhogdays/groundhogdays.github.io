I hesitate to say this, because it’s been a few years since I saw the movie Groundhog Day, but Tim Minchin‘s stage musical version at the Old Vic in London may be funnier and deeper than the original. The story is essentially the same. 
Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London.

Groundhog Day the Musical’s hugely successful and critically acclaimed 10 week season at the Old Vic Theatre, London, has come to an end. If you managed to spend some time in snowy small town Punxsutawney, this summer, you were part of something pretty special and the enthusiasm and joy of the audiences has been a delight to the cast, musicians, crew and creatives. 
It was a huge challenge for composer Tim Minchin and director Matthew Warchus to follow the world-beating success of Matilda.Yet they have totally pulled it off. Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. 
Groundhog Day will begin with previews from July 15th, with the official opening on August 16th. It will be a strictly limited 10-week season until Saturday 17th September, 2016. More information and Tickets can be found on The Old Vic website. You can also book over the phone: 0844 871 7628 or in person at The Old Vic.

Groundhog Day will be performed at the Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August, with a press performance on 8 June. The show has received critical acclaim during its initial run, being described by Sarah Crompton as “a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving.” 
Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
Groundhog Day, appropriately, is back where it started. The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen. 
The award-winning and record-breaking Groundhog Day The Musical will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne early next year. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, Groundhog Day The Musical will play exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre, for a strictly limited season from January 24th, 2024. </p>
