Bill Murray 
The real question is whether each day, he made sure the man was inside, warm and fed before he died. Or did he go back to ignoring him. Or did he scoop him up and take him to the hospital and get him checked out so when, I assume his heart gives out, he has help at hand.

Phil went so far as to call himself a god, but it's clear he couldn't change nature. 
The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment.

Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual.

Students may note Phil’s treatment of the homeless old man. At first Phil ignores the old man. Later Phil gives him money and during another Groundhog Day Phil takes him to the hospital.
