        <p>I just don't get how groundhog day has such high ratings when to me it's just like any other average 90's feel good movies that you take your kids with. I don't get how it's ranked among the other greats like the godfather and amadeus as great movies. 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Groundhog Day is such a great palate cleanser after Christmas because the holiday is already in the rearview mirror in this film. No one’s talking about Christmas when February 2 is the biggest  
"Groundhog Day" is not only secular, but it's universally human. It's free of ethnic dilemmas that might involve a story about, say, a leprechaun on St. Patrick's Day. I realize this is an American view, and it's true the observation of Groundhog Day began in Pennsylvania in the 18th century. 
In this video, we turn the clocks back to 1993 to take a look at an all-time classic: Groundhog Day!The movie follows a weatherman, played by Bill Murray, ca 
Since the movie first hit screens in 1993, Groundhog Day has only grown in esteem and TV channels like AMC often show repeat screenings each year on February 2. Watching Groundhog Day has become  
Every year on Feb. 2 he is dispatched to Punxsutawney, Pa., to cover the festivities of Groundhog Day, on which Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, is awakened from his slumbers and studied to discover if he will see his shadow. If he does, we will have another six weeks of winter. 
Anyway, it is worth repeating. Full Review | Dec 21, 2022. John Powers L.A. Weekly  Occasionally, Groundhog Day buries its head in dumb-comedy clichés. But the film-makers have depended mostly  
Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. But on his way out of town, Phil is caught in a giant blizzard, which he failed to predict, and finds himself stuck in small-town hell. Just when things couldn't  
In Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. 
Groundhog Day is an amazing movie and it’s started the idea of time loops. A time loop is where you are stuck to return to a set point after you reach a set point. The original ground hog day is great cause it explores everything one would do if you were able to replay time. 
Well, the obvious answer is Palm Springs, which I'm sure's been mentioned 27 times already. a kind of surreal and well executed concept Stranger than Fiction.

The post Groundhog Day Is Still a Joy to Rewatch 30 Years Later appeared first on ComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV &amp; Streaming Ne  Harold Ramis and Bill Murray made a deeply profound comedy  
The only element of Groundhog day that is not 'real' is the time loop, so it is closer to magical realism than sci-fi or fantasy as it is applying some magical concepts to a real world setting. In addition, the focus on repetition and its consequences is similar to a lot of work by Jorge Luis Borges, a prominent magical realist. 
Films Worth Watching Wednesday, November 14, 2012 
Just to answer the root question of if it's worth it - I see in comments that OP already started watching, but for anyone else who's curious - the show is just OK and I can recommend it only if one of these applies to you: you really like Stephen King stuff, you really like time travel stories, you really like sci-fi and have exhausted all other highly rated sci-fi shows, you love a 50s/60s  
yes its good. there is a bunch of death and kids killing each other but take it as a Mystery first and try to solve it. Its divided into 8 arcs which cover 4 question arcs (which cover the various aspects of the mystery without revealing any answers) then 4 answer arcs (which cover the answers to various mysteries and eventually the overarching mystery for the OG series). 2006 and kai cover  
It's fun. I haven't seen pt2 but pt1. It was cool to see a horror version of groundhog's day. Look at this way: you're going to watch a movie anyways.
