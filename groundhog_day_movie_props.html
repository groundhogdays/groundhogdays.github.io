Many of you know that the original base flip clock that was used for the movie was the Panasonic RC-6025. However, that is such a rare model to find and would be a costly purchase. So I recently bought the RC-6030 clock which is the same exact design, but in a simulated wood grain paint.

Groundhog Day (1993) - The clock seen in the movie is actually a prop clock that was designed to flip back and forth between 5:59 and 6:00. In addition the alarm goes off and plays the song exactly when the clock flips to 6:00. With a real flip clock the alarm can go off randomly around the time the alarm has been set to activate.

Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
In Groundhog Day, Phil Connors played by Bill Murray is a conceited TV weatherman. On February 2nd he covers the groundhog day celebrations in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The next day he awakens to realize it February 2nd all over again. He realizes he in an endless loop. At first he steals and manipulates people each day. 
Not exactly about reliving a day, but time travel: Timecrimes (2007). It's not wholesome tho. Also Predestination (2014), about time travel Edit: Source Code (2011)!
