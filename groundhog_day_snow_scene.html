Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
An old cinematic rule regarding weather was fully realized on the set of Groundhog Day. The outdoor dialogue scene after Phil’s crew arrives in Punxsutawney was shot in several degrees below freezing, without snow. 
As successful as those movies are, they all owe a lot to the original time-loop gem, Groundhog Day. The comedy stars Bill Murray as a cranky weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day festival but finds himself waking up on the same day over and over.

At the party scene at the end of the movie, Phil's piano teacher screams "That's my student!", when Phil plays the piano. This shouldn't be the case as the teacher was paid with a bag of cash Phil stole from the back of the money truck, and the day that let Phil out of the time loop was the day where he only committed virtuous acts. 
The snow was coming down at such a furious rate that hundreds of cars were stranded -- and 25,000 calls flooded 911 lines in just 24 hours. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world.
