        <p>Groundhog Burrows. Groundhogs burrows are of two types: One for the summer and another during the winter. In a summer burrow, there are multiple openings about 10 to 12 inches in diameter and are always 20 feet away from each other. 
The day before Groundhog Day 2024, The Weather Channel reported that the weather forecast in Pennsylvania for Feb. 2, 2024 clouds, potentially suggesting that Phil won't see his shadow — and that prediction was right.

Groundhog, (Marmota monax), one of 14 species of marmots (Marmota), considered basically a giant North American ground squirrel. It is sometimes destructive to gardens and pasturelands. Classified as a marmot, the groundhog is a member of the squirrel family, Sciuridae, within the order Rodentia. 
The average groundhog weighs as much as 11lbs. Despite their stocky build, they are surprisingly quick. Groundhogs are also good swimmers and tree climbers. They have two layers of fur: a dense grey undercoat and a longer coat of banded guard hairs that gives the groundhog a “frosted” appearance. 
This species forages primarily during the early morning and late afternoon. However, it does collect and eat food throughout the day as well. It is not uncommon for this rodent to eat a pound or more of food in a single day. Groundhog’s Day. The famous namesake of this species, Groundhog’s Day, falls on February 2 nd every year. During this

Groundhog Day first appeared in the local Punxsutawney newspaper in 1886,  Lifespan: In the wild, groundhogs can live up to six years with two or three being average. In captivity, groundhogs  
A groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil is central to the traditional Groundhog Day celebrations held each year on the 2 nd of February in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It’s said that if Phil emerges from his burrow and is able to see his shadow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. 
Phil lives in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where every Groundhog Day people wait for him to come out of his burrow. Legend has it that if Phil sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter will follow. Also known as woodchucks, groundhogs spend much of their days alone, foraging for plants and grasses and digging burrows up to 66 feet long.
