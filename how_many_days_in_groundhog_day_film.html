        <p>How many Groundhog Days are actually in "Groundhog Day?" By Chris Taylor on February 2, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days.

Groundhog Day (1993) - According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends eight years, eight months and sixteen days trapped in Groundhog Day. The Movie Truth review series calculated Murray spent 4,576 days (twelve years, six months, and eleven days) stuck in the loop. While the website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under thirty-four years, in order to  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Luckily, Harold Ramis stuck to his guns, and produced a movie in which the answer is more ambiguous — but definitely longer than two weeks. Between 34 and 44 days. The first step in figuring out Phil's time loop is to answer an apparently simple question: How many Groundhog Days are shown on screen? But the answer is not as clear as you might  
Almost since the film’s release (which happened 10 days after Groundhog Day), it has obsessed fans and dogged the film’s cast and crew. Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
Director Harold Ramis believed Phil Connors was trapped for 10-40 years, adding weight to his loathing of the curse. Initially, the script envisioned a 10,000 year time-loop, but was reduced to  
In one early version of the script it stated that phil spent 10000 days (27 years) repeating the same day. Many people contemplate this though and argue that he only spent around 10 years. Either way, its still a LONG time. 
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid blogger, Murray’s character relives Groundhog Day a mind-blowing 12,395 times throughout the movie. Of course, that number seems much  
To celebrate Groundhog Day 2016, we take a look back at the classic Bill Murray film and discover how many days his character actually spent in the movie. Actually, make that years. 
In the iconic film Groundhog Day, the protagonist, Phil Connors, finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day—February 2nd—over and over again. This clever premise raises intriguing questions about time, change, and personal growth, as Phil learns to embrace the repetition and ultimately transforms his life. 
These included the 38 "days shown on screen", the 414 "days mentioned" (including the "six months, four to five hours a day" spent throwing playing cards into a hat), and the colossal 11,931 "days  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  </p>
