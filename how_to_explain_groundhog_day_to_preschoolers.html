You can explain the history of Groundhog Day to your child. A long time ago (in the 1800s), people in Pennsylvania determined that if groundhogs came out of their burrows on February 2nd and saw their shadows, they would get frightened and scurry right back into their burrows, meaning that spring would come late. 
At some point people began to look to the groundhog to make this prediction. The earliest reference to the groundhog is in an 1841 journal entry. In 1886 the Punxsutawney newspaper declared February 2nd as Groundhog Day and named the local groundhog as Punxsutawney Phil. Since then the day and tradition has spread throughout the United States
