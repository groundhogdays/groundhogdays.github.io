        <p>When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. More: Where to watch Bill Murray's 1993 classic movie 'Groundhog Day' for Groundhog Day. What is  
The Groundhog sees no shadow: If he emerges from his burrow and does NOT see his shadow, then early spring weather is right around the corner. Perhaps the most famous groundhog is Punxsutawney Phil. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
According to lore, the Old Farmer's Almanac says a groundhog will emerge from its burrow on Groundhog Day. If it sees its shadow, it will retreat back into its hole and we can expect another six  
Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  But, before they made the trek to America, they checked to see if a hedgehog saw its shadow  
Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of winter by seeing (or not seeing) his own shadow. According to weather lore: Sees His Shadow: If the plump prognosticator emerges from his hole on a clear day and sees his shadow, he will retreat, and  
It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early. In 2024, an early spring was predicted. 
The focus of many was on Gobbler's Knob in tiny Pennsylvania town, Punxsutawney, on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024 as the weather prognosticating groundhog Phil sees, or doesn't see, his shadow. How did all  
Prior to 2024, the groundhog had seen his shadow 107 times and not seen his shadow 20 times, according to the York Daily Record, part of the USA TODAY Network. There were a few years in the late  
The "Punxsutawney Groundhog Club" was founded in 1886 by a group of groundhog hunters, one of whom was the editor of the town's newspaper and quickly published a proclamation about its local  
Every year on February 2nd, people across North America turn their attention to a small but significant event: Groundhog Day. This tradition, rooted in folklore, revolves around the behavior of a groundhog and its shadow. 
The Groundhog Day legend is simple: Punxsutawney Phil's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next 6 weeks until the start of spring. But why? 
A sunny day means the groundhog will see his shadow — this is taken as a sign that the next six weeks will bring wintry weather. A cloudy day means the opposite. 
Groundhog handler AJ Derume holds Punxsutawney Phil, who saw his shadow, predicting a late spring during the 136th annual Groundhog Day festivities on February 2, 2022 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end. If, on the other hand, it is sunny and the groundhog sees its shadow, the groundhog will supposedly  
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the groundhog sees its shadow when it emerges, there will be six more weeks of winter. ALSO SEE: The legend of the immortal Punxsutawney  
It’s the day upon which, according to legend, a groundhog seeks its shadow. If it’s sunny and he sees his shadow, it’s said we’ll see six more weeks of winter. 
It might not be a federal holiday, but people in the U.S. tune in to see if Phil, or their own local groundhog celebrity, sees his shadow every year on the same day, Feb. 2. </p>
