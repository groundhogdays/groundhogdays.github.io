        <p>Cuz obviously, some boob decided Groundhog Day should come way too early this year! "To be honest, for some reason it feels like it came right on time," Jaune notes as he loosens himself up to fight again before deadpanning at the criminals, "What do you guys even plan to do against that thing? 
Jaune Arc is trying to answer that same question. But some things are out of even his control. Inspired by, and drawing heavily from Live, Die, Repeat and Not This Time, Fate, this is yet another "Groundhog Day" type of fic. 
Jaune Arc is trying to answer that same question. But some things are out of even his control. Inspired by, and drawing heavily from Live, Die, Repeat and Not This Time, Fate, this is yet another "Groundhog Day" type of fic. 
One Day They'll Understand is a RWBY fanfic by Super Saiyan Cyndaquil.. Jaune and Blake are dating. No one really knows how it happened, and they definitely don't understand why it's happening, but despite everyone's utter skepticism and confusion, it seems like their resident awkward swordsman and reclusive bookworm are genuinely in love. 
Ruby said as RWBY went to hug Jaune. Everyone smiled at the heartwarming scene and at the same time, the teens all had a big group hug with Jaune in the middle. Jaune in the meantime, was surprised by the sudden affection from his friends but just smiled and slightly blushed as he was the center of attention. 
Rusted Knight Jaune Arc; Neopolitan (RWBY) Needs a Hug; Angst; I'm Bad At Tagging; Work In Progress; I'm Bad At Titles; Summary. So, there's been a lot of discourse going around on whether Volume 10 is going to get greenlit. I fear it may not happen. If that is the case, then I want to give RWBY one final send-off. 
After Jaune Arc saved Cardin Winchester from the Ursa, Cardin still told everyone about his fake transcripts. The entire student body immediately turns on Jaune, making his school life hell. The only people who stay by his side are his team, team RWBY, team CFVY, Ozpin, and the teachers. Jaune disappears. 
And on a normal day her life will be changed forever. Juane is a young boy lost and alone in the city of Mantle. and his life is about the change as he is saved and taken care of by a huntress. Join Elm and Jaune as they grow together and navigate the ocean of life. Language: English Words: 19,432 Chapters: 2/? Comments: 7 Kudos: 24 Bookmarks  
Jaune suspected this may have been planned, but without proof he chose to ignore that possibility. At the end of the long day - far longer for Jaune than the rest, it had to be said - the teams retired and tried to divvy up the beds. It went fairly successfully, although Nora attempted to claim all of them for herself initially. 
Two Minutes Silence. It’s a Time Travel fic, where after RWBY, Jaune, and Neo fell from the pathways in volume 8, they ended up back in their bodies on the first day at Beacon. Jaune isn’t the only main character, every member of RWBY and even Neo also get focused on at times. But Jaune certainly feels traumatized here based on what he’s  
Jaune survives a childhood tragedy and life in the wilderness with the most unlikely allies. The summoned manifestations of slain Grimm defend him through his travels until he meets a band of refugees and a criminal willing to help smuggle them into the safety of Vale - and Jaune into Beacon Academy where he finally finds purpose for the sword at his hip. 
Nice to meet you Jaune, and I'll catchup later Rubes!" she said before speeding off to join her friends "Ditched again, that's the third time today" Ruby said in exasperation before flinching as Jaune put his hand around her shoulder "Don't worry Ruby! You still have me and my big mouth to brighten your day" he said grinning from ear to ear 
There's much to go in this story until now, like training, initiation, and the one member of team RWBY who's been practically completely glanced over to this point! Oh noes! Don't worry, it don't mean she won't be barred from getting shipped with Jaune. In regards to pairings in general, it hasn't been decided yet for this story. 
Jaune and Finch emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks explode. Jaune stops the Harley and Finch peers around his body to see the destruction. They hear a sound and Jaune reloads and aims in 2 seconds, waiting for Cardin to walk out. 
Chapter 21: Jaune's Surprise. Day 140. Jaune woke up early as usual with him spooning Yang, this time his face was buried in her hair with his arm around her waist. He could feel that she was slowly starting to show by now. It was around twelve weeks by now and a bump was now noticeable. 
Jaune's POV – of two kids on a bike down in the canal. The image snap-zooms in. Freezes on the driver's face. "IDENT POSSITIVE" Flashes next to the blurry image of Finch. Jaune wheels the Harley around, cutting onto a street which runs parallel to the canal. Jaune hauls ass at keep Finch in sight. "Woohoo!" Nora cheered, "Jaune to the rescue!" 
The RWBY team, along with team JNPR, embarks on a journey full of mysteries as they explore ancient documents found in Jaune Arc's chest. Do the Grimm represent the greatest threat in this world? Uncovering the secrets of their friend could lead them to question everything they thought they knew about him; Jaune might not be the aspiring hero  
These loops are a collection of drabbles based off the Looping stories by Author Innortal who's are based on the movie Groundhog Day. In which a character is constantly looping through time and is aware of the resets. There will be crossovers with Innortal's series, so please check those out! They're very good and a lot of fun. 
It wasn't every day that Professor Ozpin himself dropped by to give a guest lecture. Even students who normally tuned out during history seemed alert, intrigued by the prospect of learning from one of Remnant's most respected figures. Jaune sat toward the middle of the room, leaning back in his chair, his arms crossed in a casual slouch. 
Typically, that involved the two of them swapping any interesting gossip on their respective teams (Team RWBY was way more interesting, Jaune!) for about 10 minutes and then reading comics or playing video games or eating junk food for an hour or two. </p>
