The film's director, Harold Ramis, was known for his collaborations with Bill Murray, having previously worked together on movies like Caddyshack and Ghostbusters. However, their relationship became strained during the filming of Groundhog Day, and they did not work together again for over 20 years. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world.
