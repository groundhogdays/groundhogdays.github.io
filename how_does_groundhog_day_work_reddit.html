        <p>Groundhog Day is real, in the sense that there is a real holiday and there is a real ceremony. Whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow has no actual bearing on how much longer winter weather lasts, but it's a fun tradition. It has yet to be proven whether Bill Murray actually spent

So these groundhogs come out and if it's a sunny day (and it sees its shadow) it's a shorter winter and if it's a crappy day (and it doesn't) we get a specific amount (6 weeks) of a longer winter. This is the most widely supported non-religious magical belief I know of. Maybe I'm missing something. 
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
*Note that some groundhogs did not make predictions every year in the past 20 years. Special Mention: Punxsatawney Phil. Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the  
If the groundhog does not see its shadow, the prediction is that there will be an early spring.  How does Groundhog Day actually work? Published: Feb. 01, 2022, 3:19 p.m. 
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here. Celebrated at the beginning of February, the day was called Imbolc —a term from Old Irish that is most often translated as “in the belly”—a reference to the soon

It's thankless work. His kid gets teased at school because his father is "only a janitor", but for now he just tells his son about the satisfaction of getting something done with your own hands, and the honor of earning an honest wage for an honest day's work. One day, when he's older, maybe he'll be ready.

It does everything Groundhog Day does, plus more, and it was written several years before Groundhog Day. Orson Scott Card summed it up pretty well in his review of the book: "When I finished it, I felt I had been moving with the hidden rhythm of life, that I had seen more clearly, that I had loved more deeply than is ever possible in one short  
Groundhog Day has always been one of my favorite comedies. It has a great premise and some of the best character actors in a single film. "Ned, Ned Ryerson"! The movie is such a great comedy I'm always caught off guard by the scenes where the old man dies. It is such a heart tugging collection of moments that never fails to bring a tear to my eye. 
"Groundhog Day" is basically a movie about a self-obsessed stalker taking 200 days to figure out what the woman he's after actually likes and using that info to get her. Until it's not. Because Phil does get his girl, but that isn't good enough, so the day keeps resetting. 
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years. 
Whatever she does on her repeating Groundhog Day requires a roll of quarters. Maybe she's working on coin-op Pac Man the way Phil worked on ice sculpture. I would love a Groundhog Day 2 from the perspective of Doris! 
S5 E11 Michael Scott says that he celebrates Groundhog Day privately. Go with your best theories for what he does! My theory: he goes to visit the groundhog at the local zoo and watches the reveal. He thinks a groundhog being able to predict the future weather is the most incredible thing he’s ever seen. 
I think Deathloop is a great example of how something like this can work. Like, information you get at the end of the day can then be used at the start of the next day, which will trigger something significant to change. </p>
