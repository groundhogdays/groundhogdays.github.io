Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day."

What's not to love about Bill Murray as an ill-fated weatherman who is forced to relive the same day over and over in Groundhog Day? Comedy gold. If you've ever wondered the real reasons why Murray's sourpuss meteorologist was chosen to repeat the same sadistic time loop, voiceover artist Eddie Deezen has your answer.
