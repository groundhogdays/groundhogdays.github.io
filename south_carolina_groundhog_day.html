        <h2><strong>south carolina groundhog day groundhog day in woodstock illinois</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a popular North American tradition observed in the United States and Canada on February 2. It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den, and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness, spring will  
February 2 is Groundhog Day, so I asked our Lowcountry Zoo zookeepers, do we have groundhogs in South Carolina? We do! We call them Woodchucks here but they are the same animal. Both a Groundhog and a Woodchuck are genus and species Marmota monax. They are large members of the squirrel family and are closely related to other species of marmots  
Groundhog Day is a sacred time for people from snowbound cultures. The outcome of the day will provide the subliminal message for the ensuing weeks - either six more weeks of winter or an early spring. To a 12-year-old, I always wanted the six more weeks of winter because it potentially meant one more "snow day," a vacation from school.

The groundhog (Marmota monax), also known as a woodchuck, is a rodent of the family Sciuridae, belonging to the group of large ground squirrels known as marmots. The groundhog is a lowland creature of North America; it is found through much of the Eastern United States, across Canada and into Alaska. It was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. 
There is a simple reason for male groundhogs to seize the Feb. 2 holiday. But the handlers of female groundhogs say their animals are more accurate than Punxsutawney Phil.
