        <h2><strong>groundhog day eminem reddit how many years in groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Welcome everybody to the very first SotW of February. The last time that we listened to this week's track was actually back in July of 2021. We're going back to the Deluxe edition of 'The Marshall Mathers LP2' again for the next seven days, as 'Groundhog Day' has been selected by u/hollivore as this week's featured track. 
In this really aggressive and engaging song, Eminem tells his story (once again), but this time with a nice original spin on it. He compares his life to the movie "Groundhog Day", where the main character gets stuck in a time loop. He's forced to live out a day over and over and over again. Eminem compares this to his life as a child. 
That song is so boring. Like yeah the way he rhymed on it was cool but there wasn't any energy, it was just monotone until the end of the last verse and groundhog day is a better song than legacy, first he tells the story better and em finally did a song with no hook or features, which is what I've been asking for a couple of years 
A lot of Eminem songs are though because he's considered to be one of the greatest artists of all time, so many of his albums are on the favorites list (SSLP, MMLP, TES, Relapse) and people frequently post his songs.

This is one of Eminem's most underrated songs ever. MMLP2 is underrated, in general. Hot take: this should've been Eminem's last album. He would've gone out on a high-note. Revival, Kamikaze and all of the freestyles he's put out since have hurt his legacy quite a bit. 
The official subreddit for Eminem &amp; Shady Records. Members Online mannnnnnnnnn im getting so pumped up for MMLP3ü•∂ also his name is Marshall Mathers the third so it really makes sense to have a trilogy. 
Eminem‚Äôs lyrics punish the opponents like a father does to a son. He is putting his opponents hide in the sun to turn it into leather. A ‚Äúbicycle built for a two‚Äù is known as a tandem. 
This song about Eminem‚Äôs childhood in Detroit, Michigan is based on the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. In the movie, the same day repeats itself over and over again, and ‚Äútomorrow 
"Groundhog Day" by Eminem delves into his personal journey in the music industry, highlighting the struggles, determination, and resilience that have shaped his career. The song chronicles various phases of Eminem's life and the pivotal moments that steered him toward his passion for hip-hop.

Welcome everybody to the second SotW of July. The last time that we listened to this week's track was actually back in December of 2018. But that doesn't change the fact that we're staying with the Deluxe edition of 'The Marshall Mathers LP2' for the next seven days, as 'Groundhog Day' has been selected by u/EGM445 as this week's featured track.

Groundhog Day is a movie about a guy reliving the same day over and over. Just like that day that never changes, Eminem is saying he's never gonna change his ways. Plus there's also the point of him going through the same bullshit as a kid, as u/CharmanderIsGod said. 
High agree!! Peolle need to appreciate this song more , whole song is fire af üî• It's in my top 3 best MMLP2 songs!! Bad guy , Evil twin , Groundhog day/Headlights 
He's not saying that the members of Brand Nubian are talking shit about Eminem. He's saying that Brand Nubian's 90s music is much better than Eminem's current music. This is true, but not that meaningful. 2000s Eminem is still better than 90s Brand Nubian and Lord Jamar hasn't made anything worth something in a longer time than Eminem. </p>
