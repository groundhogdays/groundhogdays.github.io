        <p>Danny Rubin (born 1957) is an American screenwriter and playwright. [1] He wrote the original story, and then co-wrote with Harold Ramis the screenplay for the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day, for which the two received a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Danny Rubin. Writer: Groundhog Day. Danny Rubin was born in 1957. He is a writer, known for Groundhog Day (1993), S.F.W. (1994) and Hear No Evil (1993). 
Three have been produced, including his big hit, Groundhog Day, the 1993 existential comedy starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. In Cambridge, Rubin has taught the screenwriter’s craft to Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, and even Nieman Fellows in workshop-format courses, “Dramatic Screenwriting” I and II.

After a lot of development and collaboration with Harold Ramis, Groundhog Day became the screenplay that ranks #3 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 funniest screenplays ever written. Danny Rubin walked through his journey with the story, screenplay and film of Groundhog Day at the 2014 Austin Film Festival. Thanks to AFF's On Story, you can

When Every Day Is ‘Groundhog Day’. Danny Rubin wrote the beloved movie and, 24 years later, the musical. In between, he lived it.

It became one of 1993's highest grossing movies and its influence has only grown from there: today, the story lives on not just in the form of the acclaimed stage musical that Danny wrote – there’s also the small matter of films and TV shows like Edge of Tomorrow, Palm Springs and Russian Doll, all of which took Groundhog Day's time-loop  
The Bill Murray movie "Groundhog Day", the holiday Groundhog Day, and the expression "Groundhog Day." By Molly Snyder Senior Writer Published Jan 30, 2025 at 12:30 PM 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13. When does a groundhog come before a woodchuck? In the dictionary. 
In recent years, Rubin adapted his Groundhog Day script into Groundhog Day: The Musical, which opened to rave reviews at the Old Vic Theatre in London in 2016 and earned him and composer/lyricist Tim Minchin the Oliver Award for Best New Musical. The show opened on Broadway in April of 2017 garnering seven Tony nominations including Best  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Although he never made an official sequel, Groundhog Day creator and co-writer Danny Rubin did reveal what happened to Phil after the film. A few years ago on his personal blog , he described Phil  
The original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990. He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985). 
Danny Rubin was the dude who wrote the screenplay for Groundhog Day and brought it to Harold Ramis to direct. But the two quickly differed in their opinions on how cheery or dark the final movie should be. Danny Rubin originally wrote the script as if Phil Connors were stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000—count 'em— 10,000 years. 
Today is Groundhog Day, when people all over the United States wait to hear if groundhog Phil's shadow in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is visible. We've been doing this since the 1800's even though it's an incredibly weird thing to depend on a rhodent's shadow to predict when Spring will begin. 
Groundhog Day had its world premiere and enjoyed a critically acclaimed strictly limited 10 week season at The Old Vic Theatre, London, in the summer of 2016.. One of the most ambitious shows ever to have been staged at The Old Vic, previews began on the 15th July. </p>
