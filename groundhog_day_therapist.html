        <h2><strong>groundhog day therapist is groundhog day on the same day every year</strong></h2>
        <p>Today, February 2, 2021, is Groundhog Day! Did you know that some therapists prescribe watching the film, Groundhog Day, to their patients? I feel that it’s one of the most perfect movies and definitely in my personal top 10 (fun fact: I went to college with Bill Murray’s son/have met Mr. Murray, and he is as awesome IRL as he is on screen.) 
A Personal Perspective: In a time of climate anxiety, political unpredictability, and technological change, Groundhog Day isn't silly. It's grounding. 
Talk to a therapist around Groundhog Day. If you’re experiencing significant mood changes during February, help is available. Groundhog Day typically marks a time between winter and spring for those in the Northern Hemisphere, and it can be challenging to cope with a lack of light and fewer daylight hours. 
Groundhog Day (1993), starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a narcissistic TV weatherman who’s somehow been doomed to relive one February 2nd indefinitely, “has gradually achieved the status of beloved. The American Film Institute rates it No.34 on its list of all-time funniest movies”

There are many paths to healing and moving past our own personal “Groundhog Day”. Support groups, therapy, meditation and workshops can all provide insight. However, it requires work and the ability to face the reality that we are choosing to cycle around in the same rotten place. 
After months or years circling the same issues, we end up with what I call “Groundhog Day therapy,” named after the early 1990s film in which a burned-out TV weatherman played by Bill Murray is doomed to live through the same day, with the same events, over and over again.

The self of the therapist is conceptualized from several points, including the embedded/embodied self (Hardham, 1996), the self in dialogue (Rober, 2005) and the narrative self (Bruner, 1997). The primary aim of this session is to explore the self of the therapist as created by the therapist's relationship to particular models of family therapy.
