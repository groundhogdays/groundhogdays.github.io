        <h2><strong>why does the day keep repeating in groundhog day today groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
Either way, today is Groundhog Day and in the 1993 film of the same name, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to live the same day over and over again, improving himself a little bit each and  
On the DVD commentary for Groundhog Day, director Harold Ramis claims, "We figure the day had been repeating for about 10 years." While that may not seem a terrible length of time, ten years is  
Responsible for popularising a unique genre, Groundhog Day stars Murray as Phil Connors – an insufferable, cynical TV weather reporter who travels to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover an annual spectacle. However, he finds himself trapped in a seemingly endless time loop where he is forced to live the same day over and over again. 
According to WhatCulture, Phil only spent 33 years and 350 days repeating the same day over and over again, or 12,395 times to be exact. P.S. In case you were wondering, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow earlier today, and so we get an early spring! 
Even those who have never seen “Groundhog Day” are familiar with the film’s premise. The protagonist, Bill Murray’s Phil, is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over. He attempts to escape the loop by changing something important, becoming familiar with the events that happen along the way and eventually growing as a  
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
However, Bill Murray's character suddenly finds himself trapped in a time-loop and repeating the same day over and over again until he eventually realises that he has to grow as a person and win  
In the film, the only way Phil could get out of the time loop was if he learned to live the day perfectly. Along the way he learned to play the piano, caught a falling child after he fell out of a  
Phil seems to be experiencing the same day multiple times, but he isn’t. He is actually not in a loop at all. Each and every one of “his days” ends with tomorrow – same as the rest of us. He always gets up the day after Groundhog day, and goes on with his life. And the rest of the world isn’t involved at all. 
Is Joseph stuck in a Groundhog Day? There’s a household drama, Joseph is stripped of his clothes, and thrown into a pit. Sounds like the sale of Joseph right? Wrong. It’s a replay – in fact, there are three similar events in Joseph's life. 
To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently. 
Without having exited the timeloop, he transformed his hell into a heaven, mastering the doctrine of eternal recurrence and understanding that all of life is a series of repeating moments, good and bad, and that in each one you must choose to do what's right for no other reason than that it's right, and try to better yourself slowly and without  
Up until now, we have not had any clue as to why Connors had to repeat Groundhog Day. Voiceover artist and ’80s character actor Eddie Deezen wrote an in-depth article on this very subject at Neatorama via /Film: The second draft of Groundhog Day says, actually, it was caused by Phil’s scorned ex-girlfriend Stephanie. 
The outdated day gained modern fame from the 1993 movie “Groundhog Day,” where Bill Murray wakes up to repeat the same day over and over. Why in the world do I need a reminder of this useless day?

Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
No more Groundhog DayI expect greatness! There shall be no more Groundhog Days feeling trapped and feeling as though you are living the same day over and over again. No, from this moment forward, we are going to shake things up and bring great changes to our lives. These shall be positive changes, and things that we can cherish forever. 
The story charts Phil’s development over the course of thousands of repeated February 2nds. Along the way, it raises questions about our own capacity for growth. How do we go about improving ourselves? How can we escape boredom? Achieve fulfillment? Wes and Erin analyze the 1993 film Groundhog Day. </p>
