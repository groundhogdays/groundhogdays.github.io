        <p>In Groundhog Day, a book that is part of the British Film Institute Press's Modern Classics series, Ryan Gilbey provides a fine history of the film's production, including a detailed account of how screenwriter Danny Rubin's original script was significantly darker and grimmer than the final film; a perceptive close reading of the film from  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Danny Rubin (born 1957) is an American screenwriter and playwright. [1] He wrote the original story, and then co-wrote with Harold Ramis the screenplay for the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day, for which the two received a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. 
Originating in a philosophical text, the original idea for Groundhog Day came to screenwriter Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis from the book The Gay Science, an iconic work from German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche where the writer describes a man living the same day over and over. From this, Groundhog Day was born, a film that toys with  
During his five-year Harvard appointment, now nearly complete, Rubin has written and sold an original script, completed two rewrite jobs, and also published the book How to Write Groundhog Day (2012), which contains the screenplay, Rubin‚Äôs notes, and his saga of how the classic film came into being, via the tortuous Hollywood path of agents

Rubin is the guy who wrote Groundhog Day the musical.  an American named Richard A. Lupoff published a short book titled 12:01 P.M. about a man stuck in a ‚Äúdisfiguration of time.‚Äù  
After a lot of development and collaboration with Harold Ramis, Groundhog Day became the screenplay that ranks #3 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 funniest screenplays ever written. Danny Rubin walked through his journey with the story, screenplay and film of Groundhog Day at the 2014 Austin Film Festival. Thanks to AFF's On Story, you can  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
In a recent Guardian article, screenwriter Danny Rubin reflects on writing Groundhog Day: One afternoon back in 1990, I was sitting in a cinema in Los Angeles waiting for the lights to go down. My wife Louise was at home with the baby, so my companion that day was a book about vampires.

Groundhog Day is celebrated on February 2. It is based on the activities of a groundhog coming out of its winter hibernation to check for his shadow. The legend is, if the groundhog sees its shadow on this day, there will be six more weeks of wintry weather. If it doesn‚Äôt, then spring weather is right around the corner.
