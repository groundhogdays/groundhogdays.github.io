Boss Level is a typical action B-movie. A classic movie that tries to copy Groundhog Day throughout. Only Boss Level is about something else, first it's for a younger audience and more violent. A good cast with 2 great actors who have almost no time. In general, although the very idea of the film is not new, it is not poorly implemented. </p>
