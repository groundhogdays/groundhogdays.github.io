        <p>Groundhog Day vs. The Truman Show 5 comments. 7 comments. Rank  Groundhog day is a lot of fun, but the Truman Show has a lot more emotional impactgot to go with  
The downside of Groundhog Day is the lack of connection and relationship growth, a feeling of loneliness and despair, because NOTHING matters and nothing moves forward. However, I think I am creative enough to make the most of this scenario to extend the time it takes to become like an eternal prison. 
It’s all there in three classic films: Groundhog Day (1993), The Truman Show (1998) and Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind (2004). Despite their tonal and stylistic difference, each of these films centres on a character attempting to find meaning in a world out of their control; all feature individuals attempting to come to terms with the  
﻿﻿ In this episode, I decipher the philosophical and sometime esoteric underpinnings to two popular 90s films, Groundhog Day and The Truman Show. Surprising perhaps to some, both films exhibit a great deal of philosophical depth and forethought. Curious ethical and metaphysical questions are raised in both, and with The Truman Show in particular. [spreaker []

I see your point of view, but I understood the Truman show as a gnostic attack on normalcy--saying that ordinary, decent life was a sham. Needless to say, I didn't like it much. 7 February 2014 at 18:46 Al said I enjoyed reading this treatment of Groundhog Day earlier today. 7 February 2014 at 20:57 Samson J. said 
On Monday, I'm going to share a special two-part post on comedy. That's because the great Steven Greydanus of The National Catholic Register is stirring up conversation about great comedies with his introduction to the newly published Arts and Faith Top 25 Divine Comedies. Read his reflections on the list and what it means, and

You're right, but for the Truman Show the nature of the TV show was slowly unraveled, yes it was known to be a TV show from the start, but details were slowly fed to the viewer, yet I can see how it's not a great example Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow are completely invalid, maybe I got hooked on the time travel somehow

Struggling to categorize it, but essentially a movie with a unique plot that usually fulfills "What if.." fantasies. Like 'The Truman Show' is kind of a "What if your life was on television but you never knew about it", or 'Groundhog Day' that is "What if you had to live the same day every day" etc. 
If you liked Groundhog Day, you should watch Live. Die. Repeat. (or it might be called Edge of Tomorrow). It’s basically the same movie as Groundhog Day, except with way more violence, gunfire, and explosions.

Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. Doesnt get any better for a premise than that.  "The Truman Show" came out in 1998, but JenniCam went live in 1995,  </p>
