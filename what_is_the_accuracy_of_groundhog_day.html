        <p>If Lander Lil "sees" a shadow on Groundhog Day, then more winter is expected. How Punxsutawney Phil fared Overall, 14 of the groundhogs had 50% accuracy or better. 
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here&amp;#039;s how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. A beloved national celebrity, legend has it that he has been prophesying when spring would arrive from his burrow on Gobler’s Knob since 1887.

NOAA released a study of Groundhog Day predictions and found Punxsutawney Phil to be the 17th most accurate groundhog in the United States. 
Every Feb. 2, the world's most famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil rises from its burrow in Pennsylvania for Groundhog Day to give the prediction on what type of weather the U.S. could expect to  
Groundhog Day celebrations around the country. Each year, Phil draws about 20,000 people to the Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler’s Knob in the Pennsylvania Wilds outside of Punxsutawney  
Phil’s accuracy issues don’t detract from what Groundhog Day is really about. It’s a massive festival event in Punxsutawney filled with music, celebrations and tourism dollars. 
As it turns out, Beau is actually pretty accurate, for our region at least. Between 2012 and 2021, Phil only had a 50% prediction rate for his home region, while Beau had 70% for the south. 
The "Punxsutawney Groundhog Club" was founded in 1886 by a group of groundhog hunters, one of whom was the editor of the town's newspaper and quickly published a proclamation about its local  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day falls on Sunday, Feb. 2, and this year will see another crowd of revelers making their way to Punxsutawney to see the big event. As is tradition, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club will  
As Groundhog Day approaches, all eyes are on Phil, but the pressure is on as the famous groundhog has a not-so-great accuracy rate. According to the StormFax Weather Almanac , Phil has an overall  
Ever wonder the accuracy behind the folklore? Here's what to know about Groundhog Day 2025. When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day is on Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. The action starts in the early  
yeah, so rightfully so. the day actually originated in pennsylvania and in punxsutawney. groundhog day isn’t just one day for the city’s groundhog club. it’s marked by a multi day celebration that even includes a groundhog ball. and this year will be extra special day for phil, as it’s his first groundhog day as a father here in alabama. 
Groundhog Day history.  Which groundhog is more accurate? By the numbers. According to a 2022 study by FiveThirtyEight.com, Beau boasts a 63% accuracy rate for predictions from 2012 to 2021  
Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here. Celebrated at the beginning of February, the day was called Imbolc —a term from Old Irish that is most often translated as “in the belly”—a reference to the soon  
Groundhog Day is a modern interpretation of several other cultures’ holidays that mark the beginning of spring, including the Celtic Imbolc and the French Chandeleur, or Candlemas Day. 
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated every year on February 2? Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition for many as they wait to see how long winter will last. As the legend goes, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it's a forecast of an early spring. 
Which groundhog is more accurate? By the numbers: According to a 2022 study by FiveThirtyEight.com , Beau boasts a 63% accuracy rate for predictions from 2012 to 2021, outshining Phil’s 45.5%. </p>
