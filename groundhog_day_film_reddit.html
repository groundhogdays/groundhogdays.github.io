Groundhog Day is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and its legacy has long-been established. The movie has earned consistent and endless praise for its performances, cozy small-town atmosphere, unique time loop concept, and near pitch-perfect screenplay. 
"Groundhog Day" (citywide) may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis, and it doesn't have a chance of being the most financially successful.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Iâ€™ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
The Amazon description for Rubin's 2012 book, "How To Write Groundhog Day," says the film has "become a touchstone for major religions" and is prescribed to patients by psychologists. Rubin described the film's message and legacy in a recent interview with Big Think, a blog and "knowledge forum."

"Groundhog Day" is basically a movie about a self-obsessed stalker taking 200 days to figure out what the woman he's after actually likes and using that info to get her. Until it's not. Because Phil does get his girl, but that isn't good enough, so the day keeps resetting.

Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time. 
we watched ground hogs day about 20+ times. we watched it so many times in a row, we had a crazy amount of lines memorized. i still love the movie to this day, and ill go out of my way to watch "new variations" --ps- what if there was a movie about having to watch ground hogs day over and over til you get it right. 
The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
I love Groundhog Day (1993) and I've seen it over a hundred times since it came out. However, I still can't get over finding out that Fred, the young groom -to-be to whom Phil bestows Wrestlemania tickets was played by a 21 yo, then unknown but now legendary actor, Michael Shannon, who would later play General Zod, Elvis, the Iceman, and many more. 
Well, the obvious answer is Palm Springs, which I'm sure's been mentioned 27 times already. a kind of surreal and well executed concept Stranger than Fiction. </p>
