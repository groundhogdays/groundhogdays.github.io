        <h2><strong>hallmark christmas movie like groundhog day bill murray gif groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Recently I am having this deja vu feeling of my life, not in a good way, but feeling a little bit stuck, and then when I woke up this morning (Asia timezone), my gut told me to watch "Groundhog Day". Since I remember I watched a Hallmark movie years ago with similar theme, I went to check and got 2 results after some searching: 
Why you'll like this movie: Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
In 2023, Hallmark crossed the plot of Groundhog Day with Hanukkah in Round and Round. In the movie, a Jewish woman gets trapped reliving Hanukkah on a loop. In the movie, a Jewish woman gets  
Hallmark's lone Hanukkah entry in 2023 centers on book editor Rachel (Vic Michaelis), who finds herself reliving the night of her parents' Hanukkah party, Groundhog Day-style. In order to escape the time loop, Rachel seeks help from Zach (Bryan Greenberg), the nice Jewish boy her grandmother is eager to set her up with. 
Hallmark’s holiday movies are famous for their predictability. Big city girl goes back to small hometown, falls in love with small-town boy over the magic of Christmas, leaves promising but  
Hallmark Channel. Hallmark’s first Christmas movie with a central LGBTQ+ romance, The Holiday Sitter stars Jonathan Bennett (of Mean Girls fame) as Sam, a work-obsessed bachelor who unexpectedly  
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
In Round and Round on Hallmark, Rachel (Vic Michaelis) is a young woman who gets stuck in a time loop after spinning a dreidel on Hanukkah, and enlists the help of a cute stranger to help break  
The first time I saw "Groundhog Day" I was reminded of a short film called "1201 pm" that I'd seen late one night when I was a teenager. It stars Kurtwood Smith. It's pretty good, they tried to make a feature film later on but I hear it's a turkey, I think the guy who wrote and directed the short also tried to sue the studio that made GD. 
Hallmark Media, who produces over three dozen Christmas movies a year, has also produced several Hanukkah movies including Hanukkah on Rye and Double Holiday. In keeping with tradition, Hallmark  
"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:

Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you.

Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. 
This movie is generally seen as the quintessential time-loop movie by many with its name being synonymous with the genre as a whole. [13] [14] [15] Christmas Every Day: 1996: An American television movie based on William Dean Howells's 1892 short story "Christmas Every Day". A selfish teenager is forced to relive the same Christmas every day  
Back during 70s, 80s, and 90s and into the early 2000s, ABC, NBC, or CBS used to have a new Christmas movie during the holiday season, usually showing up on a Sunday night somewhere between Thanksgiving weekend and mid December. Sometimes they were Hallmark Hall of Fame Christmas movies, but mostly they were made for TV Christmas movies. 
This ABC family Christmas movie is better than some of the recent Hallmark holiday movies. The writing is sharper and the cast is likable - more A list for TV than usual. The Groundhog Day formula has been used in TV movies sometimes unsuccessfully, but here they got the right elements of Groundhog.
