        <p>In the end, Animal Justice says using real animals for Groundhog Day celebrations isn’t kind or compassionate and that there are other ways to celebrate the arrival of spring. Leave the groundhogs alone. — Jessica Scott-Reid (@JessLReid) February 2, 2023. Do you think Groundhog Day is a cruel tradition? Let us know in the comments. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Correction appended, February 1, 2016. Feb. 2 is Groundhog Day, the annual holiday in which Americans allow animals to “predict” the length of winter, based on whether or not they see their  
Before Reading Begin by explaining to your students the cruel tradition of Groundhog Day. Tell them that many groundhogs are taken away from the safety and comfort of their natural habitat and kept in roadside zoos and museum exhibits—where they can’t search for food, roam freely, or even hibernate for the winter—all so that people can hold them up in front of large, loud crowds to find  
Groundhog Day falls on the second day of the second month of the year. Reader's Digest writes that the United States adopted the holiday in 1887, but its roots go back way farther in time. The tradition is partly inherited from the Pagan celebration of the midpoint between the shortest day of the year, winter solstice, and the spring equinox  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the  
The first Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney was the brainchild of local newspaper editor Clymer Freas,  where the inaugural groundhog became the bearer of bad news when he saw his shadow. 
The woodchuck (a.k.a. groundhog) is often caught between being a celebrity and a villain—one day we rely on his shadow to forecast the seasons; the next day we grumble as he makes a meal of our carefully planted garden or digs up the yard. 
However, the idea that a groundhog predicting the weather can seem bizarre, but perhaps the answer to this event can be found in its 134-year history. As stated, Groundhog Day has been a holiday in America for over a century, the first held in 1887 in Punxsutawney. But interestingly, the history of the practice goes back even further. 
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
It’S Been Done. That’s one of the reasons why a Groundhog Day TV show really shouldn’t even be a consideration. Another is that Ned, Ned the Head, Needlenose Ned, shouldn’t be the main character in this show is that a lot of people might have thought he was funny but he wasn’t a big deal after the few minutes his role took to air out each day. 
It's February 2nd, and movie fans prepare themselves for Groundhog Day with one of the most deeply philosophical films ever made.  addictions, bad habits, and so on, and life can easily pass us  
E very year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day.You  
Groundhog Day has its roots in ancient midwinter ceremonies. How did the U.S. end up celebrating Groundhog Day in the first place? It dates back to ancient traditions — first pagan, then Christian — marking the halfway point between the winter solstice and spring equinox, says Troy Harman, a history professor at Penn State University who also works as a ranger at Gettysburg National  
Groundhog Day is a day we look forward to. Right? After all, who doesn't enjoy watching an adorable, chubby, furry little rodent predict the future? The tradition is, if the animal comes out and sees its shadow, there will be 6 more weeks of wintery weather. If he does not see his shadow, there will be an early spring. 
10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13. When does a groundhog come before a woodchuck? In the dictionary. 
In the decades since the 1993 release of "Groundhog Day," the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia, has become more famous than ever for its February 2nd tradition.  His sexism is bad enough  
Phil goes through many mental stages in Groundhog Day, and they in many ways reflect the phases of an existential or spiritual crisis, when one comes face to face with meaninglessness.Phil's  
“If, according to German lore, the hedgehog saw his shadow on Candlemas Day there would be a ‘Second Winter’ or 6 more weeks of bad weather,” according to the club. </p>
