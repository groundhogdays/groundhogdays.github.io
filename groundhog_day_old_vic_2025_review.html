        <p>Groundhog Day: It’s a delight to have this marvellous rom-com back again Tim Minchin's musical adaptation of the famous 1993 film has head, heart and spark, and capitalises cleverly on its stuck  
Dispatched with novice producer Rita (Tanisha Spring) to smalltown Punxsutawny, Pennsylvania, where a groundhog predicts the weather every February 2nd, Phil puts the moves on anyone female and  
Went to The Old Vic to see Groundhog Day and I have to say the reviews from the press are spot on, we had a total blast watching this, great catchy songs, a fantastic diverse cast and a well imagined minimal set. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, laughed a lot, and even started to shed a small tear at the appropriate moments, could not ask for more.

If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage.
