The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

The movie Groundhog Day is a curious favorite of faith communities and the subject of many sermons and lessons. One year, its director taught my congregation some lessons in person when he took to the bimah. 
Every year at Passover we experience the Jewish religion’s version of Groundhog Day. We call it Seder Night – the annual event that commemorates the founding of the Jewish nation. Like Groundhog Day in the eponymous movie, the timetable on Seder night is governed by a prescriptive schedule, unchanged for over a millennium. 
Four years ago, Rabbi Pini Dunner was preparing a sermon to deliver on the last day of Pesach. He wanted to express that the ritual of a Seder night consists of “a prescriptive schedule, unchanged for over a millennium,” as he put it in his sermon, titled “Groundhog Day and the Jewish Experience.” 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks.

Ironically, the same year “Groundhog Day” was released, a seemingly seminal moment occurred in the history of Israel and the Jewish people.

The famous 1990s movie Groundhog Day that starred Bill Murray as weatherman Phil Connors who became trapped in the same day over and over, has been made into a musical thanks to the creative brilliance of Australian composer, actor and comedian Tim Minchin, alongside the original writer of the screenplay Jewish American Danny Rubin, and English theatre director Matthew Warchus.
