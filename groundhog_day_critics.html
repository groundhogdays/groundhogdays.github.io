If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
Groundhog Day is the best vehicle for his brand of silly psychosis since Murray tangled with that pesky gopher in Caddyshack. It's a novel, fanciful comedy premise that sails over any shortcomings

"Groundhog Day" offers one of Murray's best performances, capitalizing on both his comical side, his sensitive side, his angry side and his gift for simply being a subtle presence onscreen. Murray is often able to communicate more with his facial expressions than many actors do vocally, and his face is in full effect here.

In Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd.

In my role at a politics-focused newspaper, there aren’t a lot of opportunities to play movie critic. But it’s Groundhog Day again, and the 1993 movie bearing that name is among my favorites, so I’ll take the liberty just this once. 
Apparently, groundhog day is a day in which the Canadians and Americans celebrate groundhogs emerging from their borrows at the end of hibernation.

The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature.
