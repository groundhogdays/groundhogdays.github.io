Groundhog Day may be a fun tradition, but you still have to pay attention to your surroundings. 
The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day (obsessive compulsive) list of mistakes from MovieMistakes.com: When Phil wakes up at 6 AM, it’s already bright outside. At 6 AM in February, it would still be pitch-dark. When Phil has the groundhog in the truck at the quarry and is about to drive over the edge, Rita’s hair is disheveled and sticking out all around her head.

On the first day Phil wakes in the hotel, he looks out of the window and sees certain cars moving and turning. The next day (at around 19 mins) he looks out of the window again and sees exactly the same cars etc. as though it is exactly the same time, but the time is different based on the radio show that is at a different point.

PETA wants to cancel Groundhog Day and replace Pennsylvania's treasured Punxsutawney Phil tradition with a weather-reveal cake instead. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58 
In case you weren’t already feeling old, February 2 is the 30th anniversary of the release of Groundhog Day, the story of our favorite narcissistic, self-centered weatherman, who finds himself stuck in a time loop on Groundhog Day.
