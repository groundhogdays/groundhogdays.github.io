        <p>For example, it could be said that many movies announce the premise of the story in the first scene. In this case, I think that this is more than a movie where the time repeats itself, its a movie about a selfish guy who has to learn to be open to the (sometimes chaotic) experience of living, and really share with other people. 
Even in the 1990s, "Groundhog Day" was preceded by the Oscar-nominated short movie, "12:01 PM," and the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" season five episode, "Cause and Effect," which aired in 1992. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Draft One. The first draft screenplay for Groundhog Day cuts out the beginning of the film as we know it and basically starts in the middle of the story.. Here, Phil Connors – played, of course  
Some viewers may be surprised to learn that there was no major reason why Groundhog Day was the holiday chosen for the film's backdrop. In an online interview with [the film's] writer [Danny] Rubin, he explains: "There were many reasons that Groundhog Day was a good arbitrary choice. It was a good choice because it's in the dead of winter. 
Even more poignantly and audaciously than Groundhog Day, the film uses its high concept as a metaphor for facing the risk of real, sustained change to escape a destructive and hurtful routine. 
Groundhog Day wasn't the first time loop story. That honor seems like it belongs to "Christmas Every Day," a short story by William Dean Howells published in 1892. There were others after it, but it's safe to say that Groundhog Day unlocked the magic of the premise and inspired a generation of storytellers from all over the world to repurpose the idea to fit it in their respective genres and  
The next day, Phil wakes up at six in the morning on February 2nd, Groundhog Day, which had already been yesterday. From that moment on, the awareness of the repeated day becomes solely Phil’s experience, as he watches in horror the same events unfold as the day before. No one, including Rita, believes his stories about the unexpectedly  
German monks, animal bites and Bill Murray’s feud: How Groundhog Day became the film we can’t stop re-living. The 1993 time-loop movie is being celebrated this week at the Berlin Film Festival  
As successful as those movies are, they all owe a lot to the original time-loop gem, Groundhog Day. The comedy stars Bill Murray as a cranky weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day festival but finds himself waking up on the same day over and over.

Updated February 2, 2024 at 8:19 AM ET. On Friday morning, thousands of early risers either tuned in or bundled up to watch Punxsutawney Phil emerge from a tree stump and predict the weather.

FILE – Groundhog Club handler A.J. Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, during the 137th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Feb. 2, 2023. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
That scene does seem odd. During the rest of the movie, it seems as though when Phil falls asleep, the day resets. I would think the same thing would happen when he dies. It could be that the day resets at a particular time, like 4 in the morning the next day. We never see Phil awake at 4:00 AM.
