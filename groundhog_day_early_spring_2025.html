        <p>Punxsutawney Phil is the best-known groundhog who has been making predictions since 1886, according to Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. The Groundhog Day tradition as we know it dates to 1887. 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025.

According to the Farmer's Almanac, cloudy skies are expected on Feb. 2, 2025, which means that it is likely Punxsutawney Phil will not see his shadow and will predict an early spring. How to watch  
The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts that Punxsutawney Phil will not see his shadow this year, which of course means an early spring for everyone. What are the origins of Groundhog Day? 
Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  He predicted more winter 16 of those years and an early spring, 7 of those years  
An early spring will be on the way if Phil does not see his shadow.  When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day is celebrated every year on Feb. 2. This year, it falls on a Sunday. 
In 2024, Phil predicted we would see an early spring. According to groundhog-day.com, nearly all the American groundhogs also predicted an early spring. How accurate is Punxsutawney Phil? While  
Will the Groundhog See His Shadow in 2025? According to our weather predictions, February 2, 2025, will bring snow showers and cold weather. We think that when Punxsutawney Philâ€”that Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Weather Prognosticator Extraordinaryâ€” emerges from his burrow (with a little help from his handlers) to make his much-anticipated forecast, he will NOT see his shadow, which  
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day is Sunday, Feb. 2 . Though not a federal holiday, Americans tune in annually Feb. 2 to see if the famed groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will see his shadow. 
Groundhog Day Forecast 2025: Will Punxsutawney Phil See His Shadow And How Accurate Is The Rodent?  However, last year's declaration of an early spring was a pretty accurate prediction. 
"Predicting the arrival of springtime for an entire countryâ€”especially one with varied regional climates like the United Statesâ€”isnâ€™t easy," wrote NOAA in an article on Groundhog Day weather history.
