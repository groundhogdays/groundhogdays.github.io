        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) - Goofs on IMDb - bloopers, mistakes, errors in continuity, plot holes, anachronisms, spoilers and more. 
So I just realized the other day while watching Groundhog Day After Phil goes off the cliff in the truck with the groundhog, it explodes. One would think as it exploded, Phil would die. So it falls, and then Larry says, 'he might be ok'. Then it explodes, which we can probably say Phil just died, and Larry continues to say 'well maybe not'. 
Groundhog Day is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and its legacy has long-been established. The movie has earned consistent and endless praise for its performances, cozy small-town atmosphere, unique time loop concept, and near pitch-perfect screenplay. 
Sorry for the hostile response to your fun post. Modern film criticism has been ruined by finding plot holes (usually just plot contrivances or poor character decisions) and blowing them out of proportion in order to label a movie as "objectively bad." Thankfully people have noticed this but are now wary when people mention the word. 
The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58

Groundhog Day is maybe the most philosophical and interesting of all the comedies that involve someone getting a piano dropped on them. Bill Murray relives one day in his life, for seemingly no purpose, over and over. Due to the lack of explanation in the finished film, people have argued for years about what the heck the point of it all is. 
"Rubin had also originally envisioned Andie MacDowell's character Rita reliving the day with Phil, and portrayed the pair as being stuck together in the time loop for far longer than the film showed, possibly for thousands of years (Phil tracked time by reading a page of a book each day and had managed to read through the entire public library)."

My theory; piano teacher lady is also reliving groundhog day, and that's why she takes pride in having taught him everything. She taught him over those 10 or so years or however much time he needed, and she really would take pride in herself from that.
