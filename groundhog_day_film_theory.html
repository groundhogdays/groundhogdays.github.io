        <p>Groundhog Day's Time Loop Begins With Ned Ryerson According to the theory, the time loop begins the first time Phil runs into Ned and is intended to get him to sign a contract. They're supposedly friends from high school, but Phil doesn’t recognize him, thinking the man is a fan instead. 
One of the most memorable scenes in the film, you may recall, involves Phil bumping into an old acquaintance on his walk into town on that first Groundhog Day morning. That man is Ned Ryerson. You know, NED RYERSON. Needlenose Ned, Ned the Head, Case Western High alumnus who did the whistling belly-button trick at the talent show? 
In this episode of Film Theory, we dive deep into the enigmatic character of Ned Ryerson in the classic film Groundhog Day, and explore the fascinating theor 
While the "Groundhog Day" theory certainly has some validity, it nevertheless has its fair share of detractors. Given the ambiguous nature of the film's timeline, some fans such as u/831pm aren't  
A truly iconic film, Groundhog Day has been parodied time and again in the years since its release. Much of Groundhog Day's story concerns Phil's clumsy attempts to romance Rita (Andie MacDowell) and his efforts to make his place in the time loop more bearable. A great deal of comedy is derived from the monotony and how it affects Phil, with

Harold Ramis’ 1993 film, Groundhog Day, is a charming and heartwarming comedy about an arrogant egotistical weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has a change of heart over the course  
The director Harold Ramis didn't intend for his movie Groundhog Day to be heralded by religious thinkers as an example of how to live life, but that's exactly what happened after it was released  
meanings of the film. One theory in particular looks at Groundhog Day from an economic perspective. Economist D.W. MacKenzie presented the argument 11 years after the release of the film that Groundhog Day is an excellent display of monetary theory, giving a visual example of a hypothetical concept of economic ‘perfection.’ 
That's right, Groundhog Day's Devil is, in fact, Ned Ryerson. Needle Nose Ned. The theory suggests that Phil is trapped in Punxsutawney because he insults Ned and turns down his offer of a

The Metaphysics of Groundhog Day Lawrence Crocker says it’s about time, and personal identity, and free will. The 1993 movie Groundhog Day was, of course, made as an exploration of the metaphysics of time. The basic idea is that for on-location TV weatherman Phil Connors, the same Groundhog Day, February 2, in Punxsutawney keeps repeating.

The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
The Tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow (aka Live/Die/Repeat) borrows ideas from both Replay and Groundhog Day: Looped time period over and over Selfish protagonist that has to become selfless and serve others Emily Blunt’s character is named Rita just like Andie MacDowell’s character in Groundhog Day 
My sister and I annually watch this movie on Grounds Hogs day, and we always think that the bartender is in on it. My theory is that Phil is a looper, but I believe that the Bartender is someone who is aware of the loops, and is able to tell every time a loop occurs in which Phil interacts with him, hence the smirk. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

This is an interesting theory and, having also seen the film many times, is plausible, though I’m somewhat doubtful. Perhaps he grew up somewhere NEAR Punxsutawney or somewhere in between there and Pittsburgh.

Bill Murray is at his wry, wisecracking best in this riotous romantic comedy about a weatherman caught in a personal time warp on the worst day of his life.
