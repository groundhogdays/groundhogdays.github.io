Groundhog Day The Musical is brought to the stage by an award-winning creative team, including composer and lyricist Tim Minchin (Matilda), writer Danny Rubin, and director Matthew Warchus (Matilda, A Christmas Carol). Groundhog Day The Musical most recently played at The Old Vic theatre from 20 May to 19 August 2023. 
Groundhog Day the critically acclaimed hit musical is making its long clamoured for return to London’s Old Vic theatre next year. The show will run from May 20th to August 12th* 2023, with a press night on June 8th. There will be an audio described performance on July 7th and a captioned show on July 20th.

The show, which won two Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor, is based on the 1993 movie of the same name, and features music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, with book by Danny Rubin and direction by the venue’s artistic director Matthew Warchus.

‘Groundhog Day – Sharp, dark musical from Danny Rubin and the Matilda dream team makes a triumphant return’ The Stage **** ‘[Tim Minchin’s] lyrics are a blast, zinging with clever, quick wit. The show glows with bursts of comic brilliance as a result’’A stellar set, score and performances are guaranteed entertainment’ The  
Tim Minchin has announced a series of solo concert dates in London’s West End. The Australian singer/song writer, comedian and actor is currently in London overseeing the revival of Groundhog Day at the Old Vic. Minchin wrote the music and lyrics for Groundhog Day as well as Matilda The Musical which has become one of the West End’s long-running hit shows. 
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
The award-winning and record-breaking Groundhog Day The Musical will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne early next year. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, Groundhog Day The Musical will play exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre, for a strictly limited season from January 24th, 2024. 
So yep/yay, Groundhog Day is now previewing in London – there’s been lots of fun chat about it – the Old Vic have made this video to look at: For the next six weeks until 17 September, we’re putting a bunch of super talented actors and musicians (led by the remarkable Andy Karl as Phil Connors) through their very own Groundhog Day. 
Tim will perform songs drawn from his 2020 studio album, Apart Together, from his musicals, Matilda and Groundhog Day, from his TV and film writing, and perhaps even some from his early songwriting days in the late 20th century. 
Minchin, who also hinted that the production may be set to tour, added: “‘I am hugely proud of our Groundhog Day. It has everything I want in a musical: it’s funny, heart-warming, multi-layered and theatrically intricate, tackling big ideas whilst still being wildly entertaining. 
For the next six weeks until 17 September, we’re putting a bunch of super talented actors and musicians (led by the remarkable Andy Karl as Phil Connors) through their very own Groundhog Day. Every. Single. Day. With no exceptions. Except Sundays. We’d love you to come and see it before the really quite limited run ends in September. 
He played Phil in the original London production, for which he won the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, reprising his role in the Broadway production where he was Tony Nominated for Best Actor in a Musical, and he played Phil again in London for Groundhog Day’s record-breaking return season at the Old Vic this year. 
Thanks, Tim. I saw Groundhog Day on Broadway (twice) and now I’m listening to the soundtrack yet again, but with new ears. I also saw Matilda on Broadway and just yesterday caught an excellent local production by Theatre Lawrence (Kansas). Now I’ll lobby for them do Groundhog Day. I’m ordering the songbook from my local bookshop, The Raven.
