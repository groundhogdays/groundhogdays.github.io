        <p>"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:  
Without a doubt, Groundhog Day is the superior movie when comparing it to Scrooged. The 1993 film is more unique and shows off the actor's dramatic talents while including his comedic chops. Groundhog Day is the perfect balance of drama and comedy and is regarded as one of Murray's best projects (and one of the best movies of the 1990s). 
Groundhog Day is such a great palate cleanser after Christmas because the holiday is already in the rearview mirror in this film. No one’s talking about Christmas when February 2 is the biggest  
Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. 
Some dabble with the idea of goodwill toward men, others not at all, but every year you’ll likely see at least a few in the post-Christmas day TV listings. Santa won’t be climbing down any chimneys here (well, not without swearing). 1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. 
If Rowena's attitude had shifted earlier in the repeating Groundhog Day-esque plot of this Disney Channel movie, this movie could have had the potential to be a Christmas classic. Instead, Rowena's bratty, self-centered behavior in the majority of ' Christmas Again?! ' adds a bit of bah-humbug to the sweet ending. 
This ABC family Christmas movie is better than some of the recent Hallmark holiday movies. The writing is sharper and the cast is likable - more A list for TV than usual. The Groundhog Day formula has been used in TV movies sometimes unsuccessfully, but here they got the right elements of Groundhog. 
Ashley Moulton Common Sense Media If Rowena's attitude had shifted earlier in the repeating Groundhog Day-esque plot of this Disney Channel movie, this movie could have had the potential to be a  
Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
It is based on the short story Christmas Every Day by William Dean Howells and takes inspiration from Groundhog Day. Preteen Rowena "Ro" Clybourne (played by Scarlett Estevez) is a high-spirited 12-year-old who is determined to have the best Christmas ever at all costs, in an attempt to help her divorced parents reconcile. 
Here are the best movies like Groundhog Day that are actually good and bring something new to the time loop movie subgenre. 15. Doctor Strange (2016) 
This movie is generally seen as the quintessential time-loop movie by many with its name being synonymous with the genre as a whole. [13] [14] [15] Christmas Every Day: 1996: An American television movie based on William Dean Howells's 1892 short story "Christmas Every Day". A selfish teenager is forced to relive the same Christmas every day  
Christmas Do-Over is a 2006 Christmas television film starring Jay Mohr and Daphne Zuniga. [2] It premiered on ABC Family in 2006 on their 25 Days of Christmas programming block. It is a remake of a previous 1996 television film, Christmas Every Day , but with an adult as the protagonist. 
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
I think "Groundhog Day" is the best movie ever made. The story of a cursed man gaining redemption is my favorite. The 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is like classic literature. 
A Year from Now: Directed by Ricky Kennedy. With Trey Cartwright, Stef Cruz, Thomas Elam, Rosa Galarza-Mireles. In a twist on "A Christmas Carol" and "Groundhog Day" a woman experiences seven years of her future over the course of one week. 
Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas.
