It was forty years ago on February 2nd, 1976 that southwestern Nova Scotia experienced one of the worst storms in recent history. For a storm lasting just eighteen hours, it did hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage.

It was on February 2, 1976 that what is known as the Groundhog Day Gale raged on the Port City with winds of over 180 kilometres an hour which created waves of 12 meters.
