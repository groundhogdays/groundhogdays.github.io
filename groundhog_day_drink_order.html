        <p>Every holiday is a drinking holiday if you get creative enough; even Groundhog Day (February 2nd)! But no drinking holiday is complete without a signature drink. In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Pennsylvania ryes, we present to you the Punxsutawney Buck2 oz Pennsylvania rye. We happened to use Wigle Whiskey Phil's Shadow, which is finished in maple

Here are 3 drinks for each outcome for you to try! If he doesn‚Äôt see his shadow mix up: Tequila Sunrise. Ingredients: 1.5 oz Tequila of choice. ¬æ cup of orange juice. 1.5 oz grenadine 
But if you‚Äôre going to Groundhog Day a rum-based drink, this is the one. Recipe courtesy of food writer Lauren Van Mullem. They Perfectly Proportioned Mai Tai. 
Discover the intriguing story behind the iconic Groundhog Day cocktail, inspired by Andie MacDowell's character in the movie.

Groundhog Day cocktails! Same ingredients, different outcomes. If the groundhog sees its shadow, it‚Äôs warm &amp; cozy Saw His Shadow.  4 Best Drinks with Aperol  
This drink was made famous by the movie Groundhog Day (1993) starring Bill Murray as weatherman Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as his producer Rita. In the movie disgruntled weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray, right) chooses just that. Caught in an endless time loop, he relives the same day repeatedly until he gets it right. 
Discover a unique Groundhog Day cocktail recipe with step-by-step instructions and tips for creating the perfect drink. 
One of my favorite Bill Murray movies, ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù is 25 years old this year (yikes, it‚Äôs the age of someone who can rent a car). And when Andie MacDowell‚Äôs character Rita ordered ‚Äúa glass of sweet vermouth with a twist,‚Äù she inadvertently created what has now been designated ‚ÄúThe Groundhog Day Cocktail.‚Äù 
If you were living the same day over and over this drink might get boring, but for something different on a friday night, why not give it a try.

Rub the twist around the glass‚Äô rim and drop it in. ‚ÄúSweet Vermouth, rocks, with a  
Groundhog Day is particularly tied to Candlemas Day, which falls on February 2nd. This day marked the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. On Candlemas, clergy would bless candles and distribute them, symbolizing the lengthening of daylight. Candlemas Day meant a longer, harsher winter. 
If you had to choose just one drink for all time, what would it be?

Caught in an endless time loop, he relives the same day repeatedly until he gets it right.The first ‚Äúday‚Äù he sits down at a bar with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell, left), he

At first, Harold Ramis‚Äô GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray‚Äôs sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. 
Groundhog Day cocktails! Same ingredients, different outcomes. If the groundhog sees its shadow, it‚Äôs warm &amp; cozy Saw His Shadow.  4 Best Drinks with Aperol  
In Groundhog Day (1993), writer/director Harold Ramis included the detail that Rita‚Äôs favorite drink is sweet vermouth because that was his wife‚Äôs favorite drink in real life. 
If you‚Äôre looking for something a little different to break the monotony of the winter season, here are some fun and unique ways to celebrate Groundhog Day. 1. Watch Groundhog Day‚Äîand Live It Like Bill Murray! Let‚Äôs be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray‚Äôs comedic

Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  </p>
