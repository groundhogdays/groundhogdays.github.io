Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18] Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years.[9] In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". Phil's reaction at the end of the movie is pretty unbelievable anyway.

Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
One Writer Finally Deciphers The Groundhog Day Timeline. On February 2, 2011, former editor and COO of WhatCulture, Simon Gallagher, wrote a more in-depth article analyzing Groundhog Day’s events and pieced together his own timeline. 
For Director Harold Ramis, a "sense" of 10 years. 10 years is long enough for a man to change and learn everything we see him learn. But as the screenwriter says, it's open ended. There is no singular correct answer, it's to the viewer to decide. Screenwise, Phil spent 38 days that we can see, giving us a bare minimum. 
Watched this for the first time. (Though it was sad since Murray and Ramis’ friendship fell apart during the making of this movie) But I wonder how long he was stuck in that time loop? Seems like he spent a fair number of time was it 10 years? I also like that they didn’t explain it. It 
In the iconic film Groundhog Day, Phil Connors experiences a remarkable journey through time, reliving the same day over and over again. This seemingly endless cycle lasts approximately 12,400 repetitions, which translates to nearly 34 years of his life spent in this peculiar loop. 
In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day So it's safe to say the entire timeloop will never be confirmed, but it's somewhere between 10 and 100 years, up to 10,000. 
I now choose to believe the Tool album 10,000 Days was written with Groundhog’s Day in mind  after that long. This, times about 1000 for Phil. When it finally  
On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
Phil’s values had been rewarded with fame and success for a very long time, and his limbo offers only resistance to his abandonment of those values, sometimes in the form of enthusiastic blonde women. But ultimately, even the biggest breakfasts cannot make you feel spiritually satisfied.

Phil was potentially stuck in that loop for ten thousand years. That's how. Danny Rubin’s original script for the film indicated that Murray’s character was forced to live the same day for 10,000 years This factoid turns 'Groundhog Day' into a pure horror movie.

A similar estimate suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of study (just over a year's worth of time) to become an expert in a field, and given the number of loops seen or mentioned on screen, and how long Phil could spend per day studying, that Phil spent approximately 12,400 days, or nearly 34 years, trapped in the loop. </p>
