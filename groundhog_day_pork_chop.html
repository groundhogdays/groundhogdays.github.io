Fridge Brilliance: the first few times Phil is intentionally attempting to time things so that he meets Pork Chop, talks to the hotel manageress, encounters Ned, etc. as an experiment to try and see whether he's just suffering deja-vu / going crazy or whether the day is repeating itself. 
In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie. Poor Phil Connors (played with excellent drollness by Bill Murray) was forced to wake up day after day, reliving each run-in with Needlenose Ned, his producer Rita, and his cameraman, Larry. 
“Day 2:” * “PHIL:” Well it’s Groundhog Day .. again .. “Day 21:” * “PHIL:” This is pitiful. A thousand people .. freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat! What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out and they used to EAT IT! You’re hypocrites! All of ya’!

“Don’t mess with me Pork Chop!” Watch the Groundhog Day marathon on @amc_tv NOW!. 
Bill Murray stars as a jaded, selfish TV weatherman, who finds himself in a time loop: he’s forced to repeat the same day over and over, while reporting on Groundhog Day festivities. Also with Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and Stephen Tobolowsky. Directed by Harold Ramis. [Running Time: 1:43] 
“Day 2:” * “PHIL:” Well it’s Groundhog Day .. again .. “Day 21:” * “PHIL:” This is pitiful. A thousand people .. freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat! What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out and they used to EAT IT! You’re hypocrites! All of ya’! 
As the 1960’s progressed into the 1970’s The Groundhogs evolved into a fearsome and highly underrated power trio. They had moderate success in the UK, landing three albums on the Top Ten between 1970 and 1972, but they failed to make any impact on this side of the pond as many of their contemporaries did. 
Once he starts reliving Groundhog Day, it doesn't take Phil long to realize what's going on. At first, he gets totally paranoid and thinks that someone is playing a joke on him. He grabs a dude in the hallway of his B&amp;B and tells him, PHIL: Don't mess with me, Pork Chop. What day is this? 
For most of the movie, no matter how quickly or slowly Phil moves (most notably on the third day), he always runs into "pork chop" at the top of the stairs, Ned always spots him at the same place, Rita always asks "where have you been?"
