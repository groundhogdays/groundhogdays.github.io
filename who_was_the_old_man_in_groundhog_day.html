Given you were understandably likely bawling your eyes out, you may have missed a little nod hidden in the Groundhog Day scene where Phil tries to save the old homeless man from dying. 
The old homeless man is in poor health, so Phil takes him to the hospital. Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita.

A number of factors taken into consideration include the general belief that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything (in Phil's case, regarding learning French, piano, ice sculpturing, etc.), days on screen (38), days mentioned (414) and gesture days (trying to save the old man, falling kid, etc).

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. The film stars Bill Murray in the lead who portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The first time the old man dies (that Phil is aware of) the nurse tells Phil "He was just old. It was his time. sometimes people die." To which Phil responses "Not today." The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment.

At first Phil ignores the old man. Later Phil gives him money and during another Groundhog Day Phil takes him to the hospital. On that day, Phil is obviously emotionally committed to the old man, demanding to see the chart and refusing to accept the nurse’s evaluation of the situation.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days.
