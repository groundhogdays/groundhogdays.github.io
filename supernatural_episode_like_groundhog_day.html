        <h2><strong>supernatural episode like groundhog day what is a groundhog day movie</strong></h2>
        <p>Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah  
Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). They hunt evil creatures and other supernatural foes, with the first season focusing on their  
The season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" saw an interesting take on a premise similar to Groundhog Day, in which Sam is forced to relive the same day over and over again. While this would be a frustrating experience for anyone, it's even worse for the younger Winchester, who is also grieving one of Dean's many deaths in Supernatural. 
Sammy, I get all tingly when you take control like that. SAM Quit screwing around, Dean. DEAN Okay. Okay. I'm listening. So, so – you think that you're in some kind of a what again? SAM Time loop. DEAN Like "Groundhog Day". SAM Yes, exactly. Like "Groundhog Day". DEAN, nodding Uh-huh. SAM So you don't believe me. DEAN (laughs) 
Long story short, I ended up watching “Mystery Spot” before most other episodes of the show because it happened to be on TV one night and I was fully hooked. The episode, which finds Sam stuck in a Groundhog Day-style time loop that resets after Dean dies, was a brilliant mixture of comedy, angst, and poignancy. By that point in the season  
Mystery Spot takes the fourth spot on the list for Supernatural’s tip to Groundhog Day. Sam lived the same day over and over again during season three as it got closer to Dean’s Hell deal. 
I love how 'Supernatural' can create a parody and turn it upside down. Sam, just like in the movie 'Ground Hog Day' is reliving the same Tuesday over and over. The episode 'Mystery Spot' pays many homages to the movie 'Ground Hog Day'. One example is Sam catching the Tobasco sauce bottle in the diner.

While this premise can often be labeled gimmicky, a good script can make these episodes a great way to deliver mystery and character development through smart use of its time loops. With that in mind, here are 10 TV shows that did Groundhog Day episodes. Xena: Warrior Princess - "Been There, Done That" 
A Supernatural season 3 episode can explain a plot hole in the season 15 finale. Sam and Dean Winchester have always brought each other back, or at least tried to. It all started with John Winchester when he traded his soul for Dean’s in season 2, “In My Time of Dying.” 
Your right he does mention ganking him the day before. Which means that Gabriel is way more powerful than he want people to think he is. I mean Cass sending them back to the 70s took a lot out of him but Gabriel just reset time like it was walking down the street. 
With a show like Supernatural - which reveled in pushing the envelope with odd and often meta episodes - there are more than just a couple. From playing themselves acting in the show Supernatural, to suffering through a Groundhog Day, and even getting animated and teaming up with Scooby-Doo, these are the strangest cases Sam and Dean ever worked.

This is the Groundhog Day-like episode, and we all know that Supernatural is great at handling dark comedy. Also, it’s written by new staff writer Jeremy Carver, whose last script was the very

I always love these episodes. The bottle episodes where a character or characters are trapped in a time loop and have to find a way out. I can only think of a couple, and was looking for more. Xfiles: Monday (s6e14) Supernatural: Mystery Spot (s3e11) Star Trek NG: Cause and Effect (s5e18)
