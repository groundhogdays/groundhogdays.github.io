        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
February 2, 1886 - The Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper proclaims this date as Pennsylvania's first official Groundhog Day celebration. 1986 - Phil travels to Washington,  
The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd.

An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The Birth of Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney. The first recorded Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2nd, 1886, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event was organized by local newspaper editor Clymer Freas and a group of businessmen and groundhog hunters known as the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. 
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. The ceremony itself — which returned to the stage in 2022 after a COVID-19 hiatus — features dancers, music, speeches and visitors from around the world. 
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
As February rapidly approaches, so, too, does a popular “holiday” that occurs every year on February 2nd: Groundhog Day. As the folklore dictates, Groundhog Day stems from a Christian tradition called Candlemas. Each year, at the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, churches would distribute candles to help people survive the remaining [] 
Is your birthday February 2? Then your birthday is on Groundhog Day! Every year so many people reach out to the Groundhog Club to let the Club and Phil know that their special day in fact is the same day as Groundhog Day! If your birthday falls on Groundhog Day, then you need to be a member of Phil’s Birthday Club! 
Although that’s an unlikely reason, not many parents welcome their baby on Halloween Day. The list of famous people born on this day shows that these natives typically have artistic affinities, but some also chose to pursue the comedian profession. Moreover, people born on October 31 may also live longer than babies born in winter and spring.

Yes, Groundhog Day is more like Valentine’s Day. When a male groundhog wakes up in February from its three-month-long hibernation, he leaves his burrow and goes for a stroll around the ol’ territory—a tract of about 2 to 3 acres. 
The groundhog — arguably the most famous member of his species and the most recognizable of all the country's animal prognosticators — did what he has done for the last 137 years: search for a sign of spring in front of a group of top hat-wearing handlers and adoring fans at Gobbler's Knob in Pennsylvania. 
It has been every year for forty-something years. I love having been born on this day. Sure I could have been born on some other holiday, like New Year’s Day, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Halloween, or even Valentine’s Day. But being born on Groundhog’s Day is totally fun! I mean every morning on my birthday I wake up, go outside  </p>
