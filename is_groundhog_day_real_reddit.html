        <p>Groundhog Day is real, in the sense that there is a real holiday and there is a real ceremony. Whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow has no actual bearing on how much longer winter weather lasts, but it's a fun tradition. It has yet to be proven whether Bill Murray actually spent 
Except for the year the groundhog bit a politician who was looking for a photo op, causing him to drop the animal who died later that day from its injuries. No need to torture confused animals for an annual public spectacle that lasts less than a minute. Time to let this tradition die along with that poor groundhog. 
Some facts about the real borough: Punxsutawney is 98.8% white, 16.9% of the population lives below the poverty line, the median income for a family is $33,054. Let's live there! Reply reply 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

Today in History: January 23, U.S. medical degree awarded to a woman for the first time Part of the reason so many of us know about Groundhog Day is due to the 1993 film of the same name.The  
February 2, 1886 - The Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper proclaims this date as Pennsylvania's first official Groundhog Day celebration. 1986 - Phil travels to Washington,  
Groundhog Day is observed every February 2 in the United States. It’s a day for the world-famous Punxsutawney Phil and other groundhogs (a.k.a. woodchucks) to emerge from their hallowed holes  
Thanks to a small town in northern Illinois, Groundhog Day is bigger than one chubby rodent and its shadow dropping a dubious weather forecast. In Woodstock, the groundhog takes a backseat to the real cause for celebration: the 1993 Bill Murray movie that was filmed there. WNIJ’s Under Rocks team visited the famed town square with the head of the annual festival (and Groundhog Day movie  
If you've ever wondered why America obsesses over a small hibernating creature every February 2nd, you're not alone. The tradition dates back farther than you might imagine. The celebration of this part of the year goes back thousands of years-- and actually, pre-dates Christianity itself. Let's break down the legends of Groundhog Day. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
Well it was a bit tricky with groundhog day so I had to watch it many times over in order to figure it out. Trust me after you watch groundhog day for the 6th time in one weekend you feel like your head is spinning. 
Groundhog Day killed Murray and Ramis' friendship and work relationship. A grudge Murray held until Ramis was practically on his death bed. Murray saw it as a philosophical, existential metaphor for humanity while Ramis wanted it to be a straightforward comedy and trying to get every possible laugh he could out of the story. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
I think you kinda missed the point of the movie. Phil is a horrible, immoral person. He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person.

Just gave this a rewatch. 30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun. 
From what I remember, Groundhog day used to be much more akin to tailgating a college football playoff game. Lots of drinking, college kids, kind of wild, to be honest. I can remember going with my dad as a kid, and one of the guys in the top hats on stage was so completely shitfaced by the time they pulled Phil out that he could barely stand.
