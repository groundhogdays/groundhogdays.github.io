        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic.

It's clearly established that Phil's day restarts at 6:00 AM. He wakes up in the bed and breakfast to Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe," and the day begins the same way every single time (the weather discussion with the proprietor, meeting Ned, etc.). But what would happen if Phil just stayed awake? 
I would actually argue that steins;gate is the reddit version of groundhog day, since it takes itself so seriously. I watched this anime until there were 1-2 episodes left, and I was so bored with it by then that I didn't bother to finish it. which is very atypical for me. I either drop something fast or watch it through usually. &gt;&gt; 
Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual. Even though Phil Connors’ life resets every February 2 at 6:00 a.m., the movie also shows that for each Groundhog Day he experiences, the world still continues on for  
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
I just don't get how groundhog day has such high ratings when to me it's just like any other average 90's feel good movies that you take your kids with. I don't get how it's ranked among the other greats like the godfather and amadeus as great movies. 
Reddit; Email ! Groundhog Day is one of the best comedies ever made, a clever, heartfelt romance with a surprisingly robust philosophical backbone. Harold Ramis and Bill Murray’s movie tells the  
Feb. 2 is the 139th celebration of Groundhog Day. Some folks believe if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, we will have six more weeks of winter, and if he does not see his shadow, winter will end  
I think you kinda missed the point of the movie. Phil is a horrible, immoral person. He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person.

Groundhog day has always been a more muted color grading, and its not dramatically different. Audio is also a little better I'd say. Overall: A 5 to 15% upgrade in picture quality makes this disc the definitive release and the best the film has ever looked, but not dramatically so. 
I just watched the Groundhog episode for the first time. I'm only at 2 minutes so far. I'm seriously disturbed by how hurt the groundhog got, and how real the whole incident looked. It looks like Gary the groundhog actually got seriously hurt with a major injury from Amy putting her hand on him and the cage falling.

"Groundhog Day" is basically a movie about a self-obsessed stalker taking 200 days to figure out what the woman he's after actually likes and using that info to get her. Until it's not. Because Phil does get his girl, but that isn't good enough, so the day keeps resetting. 
A discussion of all things Groundhog Day the musical. Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin with the book by Danny Rubin. It is based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis. 
I love the Groundhog Day reference at the end, it gave the movie some more cred imo as it isn't trying to be 100% original and Groundhog Day was 1993 and not, well, a slasher and also because Groundhog Day is 1 of my favorite movies. I've been seeing it every year on Groundhog Day since I was a kid. gets a 9/10 for me. </p>
