        <h2><strong>why was groundhog day not filmed in punxsutawney groundhog day movie pencil scene</strong></h2>
        <p>Believe it or not, Groundhog Day wasn’t even filmed in Punxsutawney or at Gobbler’s Knob (More on that in the “fun facts” below). It certainly had a huge impact on the small town though. Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000.

The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
7: Bill Murray absconded from the site of another project he was filming to attend Groundhog Day festivities in 1992, a year before the film Groundhog Day was released. 8: Punxsutawney Phil, according to legend, is the original groundhog, as his life is extended another seven years every summer and he swigs a gulp of his “groundhog nog” at  
We have all enjoyed the genre over the years, so let’s take a look back on the original with this list of 15 facts you might not have known about the Bill Murray classic, Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was not filmed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The movie might have been set in Pennsylvania, but it was actually filmed in Woodstock, Illinois  
Set in Punxsutawney, a real town in Pennsylvania with a famous groundhog named Phil, Groundhog Day was entirely filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. This beloved comedy classic has stood the test of time since its release in 1993. One of the key elements that make the film so memorable is its setting, which plays a crucial role in the plot. 
There are not a lot of hotel options in Punxsutawney, so many people who spend Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney will stay in a neighboring town with a greater selection of guest rooms.

Groundhog Day is celebrated February 2nd at “Gobbler’s Knob” just outside of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, USA. But that's not where you'll find the filming locations from the 1993 Bill Murray film. To recreate those scenes you'll have to head to Woodstock, Illinois. The SetJetters app will help you f 
A Groundhog Club handler holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather-prognosticating groundhog, during the 133rd celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2, 2019. 
The crowd size at 1992’s Groundhog Day celebration was estimated to be around 3,000. That number pales in comparison next to the crowd sizes of more recent years, when there are estimated to be 30,000-40,000 spectators at the event. 
In this blog post, we’ll take a deep dive into the filming locations of Groundhog Day, uncovering the real-life town that stood in for Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, and why these settings resonate with American audiences. Let’s relive the magic of this classic movie by exploring the iconic spots where it came to life. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, PA - FEBRUARY 02: Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil climbs on the top hat of his handler after Phil did not see his shadow and predicting an early spring during the 127th Groundhog Day  
Which is why I’m eager for the playful distraction Punxsutawney Phil provides. Groundhog Day 2025 is upon us, and you know the program: Every Feb. 2, Phil emerges from his burrow in Punxsutawney  
Members of Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, organized in 1899, care for Phil at a customized space beside Punxsutawney Memorial Library — where there’s a window with a view into the creature’s burrow. The Punxsutawney groundhog makes predictions but he’s not always predictable. 
Bill Murray could have woken up on Groundhog Day in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, not Woodstock. The town came close to becoming the film location for Murray’s iconic 1993 film, “Groundhog Day.” As anyone with any knowledge of either the film or Woodstock knows, Murray’s character ended up repeating his day in Woodstock.
