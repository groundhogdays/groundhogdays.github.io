        <p>Phil (Bill Murray) describes his struggle of reliving a single day to the localsDirector: Harold RamisIn this scene: Bill Murray, Rick Overton, Rick Ducommun 
** For educational purposes only ** GROUNDHOG DAY- This film is a classic. 50 years from now people will still be laughing at this and being moved by its me 
Phil Connors bowls a perfect game in this scene that didn't make it into the final version of the filmvideo cut for use at The Groundhog Day Project - http:/ 
The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him  Woodstock City Lanes was used for the bowling alley scene. [53] 
Such is life for Bill Murray’s character in “Groundhog Day,” Harold Ramis’ classic 1993 comedy about a sarcastic Pittsburgh weatherman forced to relive a miserable Feb. 2 over and over and  
Hell, in a couple of deleted scenes, he's effortlessly dominating the pool table and the bowling alley. Phil's last, beautiful, newscast on the last day of the loop, after he sadly fails to save the old homeless man. Every other newscaster points their mikes to him as he embraces the groundhog's proclamation of a long winter; 
Every scene was upscaled to HD, colour corrected to match the Blu-Ray and added 35mm grain. Every scene also had its sound design rebuilt, and rescored, with tracks from the film, or a song from the Ghostbusters soundtrack, used as diagetic music in the pool hall and bowling alley 
Probably the scene that always sticks out the most to me is when Phil’s in the bowling alley talking to his new pals Gus and Ralph.  //steadilyskippingstones  
This scene depicts Phil and his bowling alley drinking buddies crashing into the large groundhog-shaped garbage can and getting pulled over by a police officer. Fans report seeing the garbage can, the actual movie prop, at the local library. 
Funny scene from the movie "Groundhog Day". 
TAGS. bowling ACTORS. Bill Murray, Rick Ducommun, Rick Overton. SYNOPSIS. A narcissistic TV weatherman, along with his attractive-but-distant producer, and his mawkish cameraman, is sent to report on Groundhog Day in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself repeating the same day over and over. 
Phil (Bill Murray) and friends go for a late night booze cruise. #GroundhogDay #BillMurray #movie #moviescenes #movieclips Watch Groundhog Day Now:

Wayne’s Lanes/Bowling Alley. 109 E Church St. Early in the film, when Phil is still trying to figure out what is happening, he has a coffee and contemplates his fate with strangers at the bowling alley. The real bowling alley is Wayne’s Lanes, another of the Groundhog Day movie filming locations in Woodstock. 
5. State a life-lesson you can take from this movie. Suggested Response: Answers will vary. One good response is that life is meaningless and unsatisfying unless people extend themselves to others. 
Groundhog Day Locations. This 1993 comedy film is set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, a borough in Jefferson County. But none of the scenes from the movie were filmed there. Instead, the Groundhog Day production took place in different locations around Woodstock, Illinois, approximately 61 miles northwest of Chicago. 
So is Groundhog Day flawless? After weeks of filming the same scenes, with the same cast and background extras you would think that something would go awry. I challenge you to find a flaw. If, in celebration of the 30th anniversary, you plan to watch Groundhog Day on this Groundhog Day (February 2) see if you caught the mistakes on the list below. 
Today, many of us will recall the American comedy film “Groundhog Day.” Originally released in 1993, it stars the incomparable Bill Murray as Phil Conners, an insufferable Pittsburgh weatherman. A minor local celebrity who believes himself destined for much better things, he resents his piddling assignment to report on the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, []
