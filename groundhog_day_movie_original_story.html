        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, "I Got You Babe" by Sonny &amp; Cher. His memories of the "previous" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
Groundhog Day was nearly a $3 million independent movie.  Rubin wanted an original story, Columbia wanted a big comedy, Ramis wanted – and ultimately got – both.  it’s interesting to  
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
Groundhog Day. Movie: Directed by Harold Ramis, Screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis. Inciting Event: After covering Groundhog Day and being stuck in Punxsutawney, Phil wakes again at 6AM to his clock radio playing “I’ve Got You Babe,” the same song (a recurring motif of the film) as the previous day . He realizes it is not a radio  
The original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990. He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985).

It was  
Of course, “Groundhog Day” is about a lot more than that. It has been called “existential, surreal, loveable, sweet and sentimental, brilliantly imaginative” and, by one “Washington Post” critic at the time of its re-lease, a movie that “will never be designated a na-tional film treasure by the Library of Congress.” The 
According to IMDB, the plot centers around Phil (played by Murray), a Pennsylvania-based weatherman reluctant to cover a story about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who predicts the weather every  
The original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990. He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985). Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless. 
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things explores the romantic side of time loops. Based on a short story by Lev Grossman, it follows a teenager named Mark (played by Kyle Allen) who's stuck in a time loop with another teen named Margaret (played by Kathryn Newton). 
In my passion for this film I even read the original script.  ct-sta-slowik-groundhog-day-st-0201-20170131-story.html  that Groundhog Day has a deep meaning or  
Murray had creative differences with the director. First and foremost, Murray had the idea that Groundhog Day should be more of a thinker piece—the type of movie that makes you question life and  
The original ending of the movie Groundhog Day was intended to have Phil and Rita get married and choose to stay in Punxsutawney. This ending would have represented Phil's growth and transformation throughout the film, as he learns to appreciate the small town and finds happiness in his new life with Rita. 
Danny Rubin (born 1957) is an American screenwriter and playwright. [1] He wrote the original story, and then co-wrote with Harold Ramis the screenplay for the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day, for which the two received a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. 
The movie is basically a comedy, but there’s an underlying dynamic that is a little more thoughtful. Like “Scrooged,” Murray’s dreary 1988 film, this is a movie about a grouch in the process of self-redemption: A supernatural force is showing him his weaknesses.
