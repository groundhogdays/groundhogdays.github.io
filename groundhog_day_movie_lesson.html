        <p>It's Time to Celebrate 'Groundhog Day' : 10 Life Lessons You Can Learn from the Bill Murray Comedy. The 1993 movie is deeper than you might think 
State a life-lesson you can take from this movie.  Groundhog Day: the perfect comedy, for ever by Ryan Gilbey, The Guardian, Thursday 7 February 2013; 
The movie Groundhog Day is hilariously entertaining, touching, and has thousands of implicit lessons for improving one’s life, community, and the world. Some of you may know I wrote my dissertation on the 1993 romantic fantasy starring Bill Murray, directed by the late Harold Ramis. Anyone looking to glean its leadership lessons, please read on. 
The film is about a TV weatherman called Phil Connor, played by Ray Murray, who, for some unexplained reason, is stuck in a time loop and wakes up every day on the same day and in the same place: 2nd of February, Groundhog Day, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The focus of the story lies in Phil’s character arc and development. 
The movie is my wife’s favorite, and probably in my top 10. In his reappraisal of the movie, Roger Ebert wrote, “Groundhog Day is a film that finds its note and purpose so precisely that its genius may not be immediately noticeable. It unfolds so inevitably, is so entertaining, so apparently effortless, that you have to stand back and slap  
If you haven’t seen the movie Groundhog Day, you’re either very old, very young, or completely detached from contemporary culture. Upon its release in 1993, the title instantaneously became a  
6. You Can’t Plan a Perfect Day Anyone who has ever tried to plan the perfect first date knows that there’s no way to create perfect. It just happens. Phil tries to create the ideal day to  
The movie Groundhog Day illustrates that being trapped in repetitiveness is only broken by actively choosing to change our outlook and behavior. Like Phil, we have the power to reshape ourselves by learning life’s lessons, appreciating each moment, connecting meaningfully with others, and working towards self-improvement. 
The good new is that Punxsutawney Phil predicts an early spring. This day always reminds me of one of my favorite movies, Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day. Those of you who have watched the movie already know this, but the premise is that Bill Murray’s character, reporter Phil Connors, is stuck reliving the same day over and over again. 
Explore Groundhog Day (1993) with these movie discussion questions — about time loops, personal transformation, and more. Character Development. How does Phil’s perception of himself change throughout the film? Discuss key moments in his character development. Discuss the moral lessons Phil learns during his repeated days.

For many of us, Groundhog Day is synonymous with the 1993 movie of the same name. Considered one of the greatest comedies ever made, the offbeat film illuminates the power of repetition—a force CEOs can harness to enhance performance, often to their surprise. 
Phil decides to learn how to play the piano, and finds a teacher in town to teach him. #funny #groundhogday #billmurray 
At first glance, Groundhog Day seems just like a light comedy, but underneath the surface there’s a lot of wisdom to take from it. The joyful way this movie shows us how our perspective towards  
Bill Murray shines in one of his best roles, with a great supporting cast. The storyline is timeless and endlessly entertaining. The existential themes of Groundhog Day are deeply meaningful. 
Phil’s efforts to play the piano in Groundhog Day are a small-but-important illustration of both that element in the movie and in our own lives. Each new “day,” he receives a lesson from an increasingly mystified piano teacher—a halting, mistake-prone beginner at first who slowly plays himself into a place of competence and, ultimately  
However, Punxsutawney Phil will let us know Sunday, Groundhog Day, when we can expect spring to officially arrive. Danny Rubin attended Gainesville High School and was the screenwriter for “Groundhog Day” the movie, a 1993 comedy featuring Bill Murray. Via video, he introduced Mayor Harvey Ward on Wednesday. 
Hey, it makes as much sense as the movie “Groundhog Day”! In the movie, Bill Murray plays an obnoxious TV anchorman trapped in an endless time loop. Each day he wakes and relives Feb. 2 over and over in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
The director Harold Ramis didn't intend for his movie Groundhog Day to be heralded by religious thinkers as an example of how to live life, but that's exactly what happened after it was released  </p>
