        <p>What Song Is Playing Every Morning When Phil Connors Bill Murray Wakes Up At The Bed And Breakfast In Punxsutawney? Music is a crucial part of the fun in “Groundhog Day” (1993), which sees a bed and breakfast in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania being rented out to the cast of the film’s fictional character, Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray). 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film which follows the eccentric weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray.

Amazingly, the torturous time equates to repeating the same day 12,395 times. Is Bill Murray really playing the piano in Groundhog Day? Bill Murray – Groundhog Day Despite using a double for the close-ups, Bill Murray learned just enough piano to play some of Rachmaninov’s ‘Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini’. 
Phil, fascinated by the classical piano song after having heard it on the radio, decided to learn to play piano. So he found a teacher and in order to get a  
Bill Murray does not play the piano regularly. However, he did learn to play just enough to appear passable in his “Groundhog Day” piano scene. Close-ups in the scene were performed by a double but Murray did play at least perform some of the music in the scene. 
Did Bill Murray learn piano for Groundhog Day? Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, took piano lessons at the home in the film . The house was built in 1893 but has been updated generously over the years. 
Bill Murray is a multi-talented actor, comedian, and musician. He has appeared in many films and television shows, including Groundhog Day. In this popular movie, Murray plays the role of Phil Connors, a man who is stuck in a time loop and must relive the same day over and over again. 
Somehow, these weighty topics get weaved through many hilarious moments, thanks largely to the efforts of star Bill Murray.For Murray, Groundhog Day proved his acting skills could take on broader  
Over time, the clock radio becomes a sort of Doomsday bell, endlessly signaling to Phil that he has failed to escape the endless cycle of Groundhog Days. What song does Phil play in Groundhog Day? He accidentally plays Bill Murray while at the piano teacher’s house playing Sergei Rachmaninoff’s “Rhapsody on a Theme by Paginini”.

When Phil plays Sergei Rachmaninoff’s “Rhapsody on a Theme by Paginini,” he is actually playing Bill Murray at the piano teacher’s house. 
In the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character experiences a time loop where he is forced to relive the same day repeatedly. This phenomenon causes him to undergo personal growth and self-reflection as he tries to break free from the cycle by changing his actions and attitudes towards others. 
2.According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. Woodstock Square Park, which was Gobbler’s Knob in the film.Photo: activerain Another website, claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
The film was not filmed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, but actually in Woodstock, Illinois (just fifty miles from Bill Murray's hometown of Wilmette, Illinois). There is a small plaque that reads "Bill Murray stepped here" on the curb where Murray continually steps into a puddle.
