Groundhog Day is a tradition that has taken place annually in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since Feb. 2, 1987. A groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, is brought out at sunrise to make a prediction on how the remaining winter will play out. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it).

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Brighton early, that’s when the groundhog checks his shadow. 26. Knock, knock! Who’s there? Beth. Beth who? Beth wishes to you this Groundhog Day. 27. Knock  
yeah, so rightfully so. the day actually originated in pennsylvania and in punxsutawney. groundhog day isn’t just one day for the city’s groundhog club. it’s marked by a multi day celebration that even includes a groundhog ball. and this year will be extra special day for phil, as it’s his first groundhog day as a father here in alabama.

The lasting popularity of the 1993 Bill Murray movie Groundhog Day, which was set in Punxsutawney but filmed in Woodstock, Ill., has done much to boost the event’s popularity. At points in the 1970s, attendance dropped down to the low double digits. 
Punxsutawney Phil will predict if winter will last or spring will arrive early during the annual festivities on Feb. 2. Getty Images. The group argued in the Jan. 21 letter to Tom Dunkel, president of the Pennsylvania-based club, that the 138-year-old tradition should be scrapped, noting that Phil’s weather duties are “no piece of cake for him.”
