        <h2><strong>groundhog day movie bartender how many days was bill murray in groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>My sister and I annually watch this movie on Grounds Hogs day, and we always think that the bartender is in on it. My theory is that Phil is a looper, but I believe that the Bartender is someone who is aware of the loops, and is able to tell every time a loop occurs in which Phil interacts with him, hence the smirk.

Not sure if this has already been discussed or not, but I think the bartender knows what's going on. Maybe he's God or a higher power putting Phil through this. I've seen this movie at least 25 times and I've always thought he had something to do with it. CLUES: 1. If he is a higher power there to observe, he purposely rarely speaks just observes. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Throughout the film, Phil seems to be the only person in Groundhog Day who knows what he is going to. However, there is a bartender who repeatedly observes Phil, often with a smile. He does this especially when Phil is trying to win over Rita. Was it possible he was suppose to symbplize an angel of sorts? Sent down to make sure Phil would change. 
My theory is that the bartender is an immortal who controls the time loop and traps Phil until he becomes a better person. I think the cameraman is next to relive Groundhog Day over and over because he gets the same look from the bartender at the end of the movie on the last day that Phil is trapped.
