        <h2><strong>where do they celebrate groundhog day groundhog day icebreaker</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
The roots of Groundhog Day aren’t as random as they might seem.  Pagans would celebrate February 1 or 2 with a festival of light to mark the start of spring. According to Gaelic legend, if  
Groundhog Day is a popular tradition that takes place in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. Every year, Groundhog Day is on February 2. Groundhog Day came from the Pennsylvania Dutch. The colonists believed that if a groundhog came out of its burrow and saw its shadow due to clear weather, it would retreat back into  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
3 of 15 | . FILE - The groundhog saw his shadow, Feb. 2, 1954, as the sun peeked through an overcast sky at Washington Park Zoo in Milwaukee, Wis. The arrival of annual Groundhog Day celebrations Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, will draw thousands of people to see celebrity woodchuck Phil at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa. — an event that exploded in popularity after the 1993 Bill Murray movie. 
It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people. But the biggest change came following the 1993 Groundhog Day movie starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (German title: Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier). The crowds soon swelled to 10,000. 
The first-ever Groundhog Day was created by a local newspaper editor Clymer Freas around 1886, who convinced Groundhog hunter and local businessman, and all members of his Punxsutawney Groundhog club on the idea of Groundhog Day. Together, they all made their way to Gobbler’s Knob where the Groundhog would make the final decision on the weather. 
The Groundhog Day ceremony in Punxsutawney is conducted in Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German. Groundhog Day is also celebrated in other countries, such as Germany, where it is known as "Siebenschläfertag" or "Seven Sleepers Day." In Alaska, instead of a groundhog, they use a marmot to predict the weather on February 2nd. 
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people.
