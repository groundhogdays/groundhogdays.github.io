        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
In a straightforward example, some TV channels have aired all-day marathons of Groundhog Day on Groundhog Day, such as Sky Movies and AMC. Many TV showings of the trope-naming film also air the same commercial multiple times in a row or have every break consist of the same commercials in the same order. 
The musical adaptation of Groundhog Day, which opened at the Old Vic Theatre in London in 2016 and then transferred to Broadway in 2017.With a book written by Danny Rubin (who penned the original film) and songs by Tim Minchin, the musical tells the familiar story of disgruntled weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a "Groundhog Day" Loop where he is forced to relive the titular holiday over and  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day is a trope where a character (usually only one character) is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of time (often exactly one day) over and over, until something is corrected. The trope is named for the film Groundhog Day, which established the trope in popular culture. It's a niche fanfic trope, but exists in many fandoms. 
Groundhog Day is a well-loved 1993 film that massively popularized the time loop trope. With Bill Murray at his deadpan best and a much lauded script, the film is considered a modern classic. 
The popularity of the “Groundhog Day Loop,” as the wonderfully obsessive TV Tropes site defines it, is a “plot in which the character is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of  
The popularity of Groundhog Day caused the term "groundhog day loop" or "groundhog day trope" to mean a repetitive situation or, specifically in fiction, to stand for the narrative concept that  
Pop Culture Holiday: TV stations typically celebrate the film on February 2nd along with the real Groundhog Day. To keep the reference, some stations will run a marathon of nothing but the movie over and over until the day passes. Retroactive Recognition: The assistant weatherman who's taking Phil's slot for the 10 o'clock show? It's Mozzie  
It's also a common TV show trope: Star Trek TNG: Cause and Effect (pre-dates Groundhog Day) Xenia: Been There, Done That Stargate SG-1: Window of Opportunity (IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING‽) Supernatural: Mystery Spot Legends of Tomorrow: Here I Go Again Agents of SHIELD: As I Have Always Been And a bunch of others. 
Phil's Driven to Suicide montage, while a brilliant bit of Black Comedy, is also pretty tragic when you think about it. Phil then wakes up to find himself still trapped in the loop. His subdued "Aw, nuts" when he wakes up just drives it home. He  
Phil had to overcome the seven deadly sins in order to escape the time loop.Almost all of the seven deadly sins make an appearance in the movie. Think about it: Sloth: Sitting around in a bathrobe watching game shows till he has them memorized. 
The Swedish title translates as "Monday the entire week". The movie, however, does not specify what day of the week it is supposed to be, and Groundhog Day (February 2) in 1993 was a Tuesday. The German title of the movie is Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier, which can be translated as "The groundhog greets every day". The title has been  
For a little bit of Black Comedy, the montage of Rita slapping Phil day after day (sort of), even though it leads directly to his Despair Event Horizon. When Rita first reveals she majored in Nineteenth Century French Poetry, Phil can't help guffawing and exclaim, "What a complete waste of time!" 
Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son is a direct video game sequel to the original Groundhog Day film. You play as the charming but arrogant Phil Connors Jr., who grew up alongside his brother Jake and sister Sophie in the shadow of their father - a man who spent a lifetime repeating a single day until he had made it perfect. 
Phil, while he has lived the same day, still did different things from day to day. Lastly, Phil can't just 'commit a crime' metaphorically speaking to get himself re-sealed in a time bubble. Since he ultimately has no choice but to get to grips with no longer being in the time bubble, presumably he eventually just knuckles down and gets used to it.

Why It's Important to Contemplate How the Time Loop Works Part One: Recursion vs. Iteration Computer scientists would probably be familiar with recursive vs iterative loops. For those who aren't, here's an analogy; imagine you wish to read a  
From the musical: The mayor is doting over Phil the groundhog before the party, with Rita in proximity, and consistently notes that the smiling groundhog has a "tint of sadness" each repeating day. But on the perfect day, Phil the weatherman's final day in the time loop, the "tint of sadness" line is conspicuously absent.
