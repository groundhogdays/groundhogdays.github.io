        <p>It's Groundhog Day Texas-style on February 2 as Bee Cave Bob the armadillo will predict either an early spring or prolonged winter for the 15th year. 
History of Armadillo Day. When we said “West Pole” earlier, we weren’t kidding. The Texas legislature officially declared Bee Cave as the planet’s geographical west pole in 2007. A few years later, a group called “The Benevolent Knights of the Raccoon” started Armadillo Day on the spot. 
On Groundhog Day, instead of relying on the traditional shadow-fearing rodent to determine whether there will be six more weeks of winter, Gator Country in Beaumont will look to its star alligator  
DALLAS — Though we may know the legend, it is difficult for Texans to truly celebrate or otherwise observe Groundhog Day. The 138-year-old tradition of a bunch of men in Pennsylvania gathering  
For much of the country, it’s known as Groundhog Day, built around the personage of Punxsutawney Phil. In Texas, however, it’s Armadillo Day, which rests on the prophetic powers of Bee Cave Bob. Bee Cave Bob’s career began in 2012, when a group of buddies in Central Texas—formally known as the Benevolent Knights of the Raccoon—decided  
Armadillo Day, which is Texas’ version of Groundhog Day, was created in 2010 by a group of friends officially known as the Benevolent Knights of the Raccoon. Mike Burke, who is part of the group that started the annual tradition, previously discussed his faith in Bee Cave Bob’s ability to accurately predict the weather in a call with  
On May 31, 2007, the Texas state legislature officially recognized the town as our planet’s geographical western pole on the 98th meridian. Why? To add to the greatness of Texas! When compared to our other forecasting friend, the groundhog, the armadillo is bigger. A groundhog is about 16 inches long and around eight to nine pounds.

Texas recruits the help of a special critter each year to help predict the departure of winter.  Feb. 2 is most commonly referred to as Groundhog Day across the country; however, Texans know it  
We’re talking about Bee Cave Bob, an armadillo from Katy, Texas who can predict the changing of the seasons. This is Armadillo Day. The first Armadillo Day took place in 2012 outside of Austin in a town called Bee Cave, which our state legislature officially recognized in 2007 as the honorary location of our planet’s geographical western pole. 
For much of the country, Feb. 2 is known as Groundhog Day. Punxsutawney Phil has been prognosticating spring’s return on that day for more than 135 years. In Texas, however, the day is known as Armadillo Day, and the predictions come from Bee Cave Bob. The nine-banded armadillo has been on the job since 2010. 
It's Groundhog Day Texas-style on February 2 as Bee Cave Bob the armadillo will predict either an early spring or prolonged winter for the 15th year.

Phil’s handlers said that the groundhog has forecast six more weeks of winter. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

The groundhog saw his shadow on Groundhog Day- meaning six more weeks of winter. By Samantha Davies • Published February 2, 2023 • Updated on February 2, 2023 at 10:15 am NBC Universal, Inc. 
Annually, Groundhog Day falls on Feb. 2. Here's the tradition behind the holiday and why PETA wants to change it. 
BEE CAVE, Texas — It's no secret that the state of Texas likes to do things its own way, and Groundhog Day is no different. While the rest of the U.S. trusts Punxsutawney Phil's prediction, Texans prefer an armadillo's expertise. Bee Cave Bob the armadillo is the state's resident weather enthusiast and mascot for Armadillo Day. 
Armadillo Day started in Bee Cave, Texas, a town just outside of Austin. The tradition started 10 years ago by a group called the Benevolent Knights of the Raccoon, according to Click 2 Houston . “We have BBQ or chili and then we release the armadillo to see if he will see his shadow and can predict the weather,” Bee Cave Bob's handler  
Today is Armadillo Day, Texas’ version of Groundhog Day when Hill Country armadillo Bee Cave Bob determines the forecast for the next six weeks. How accurate is the little nine-banded weatherman? In the last 136 years, groundhog Punxsutawney Phil has had a 39% accuracy rate, opting for six weeks of winter 108 times. </p>
