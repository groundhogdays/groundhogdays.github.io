Personality smart, self-assured, and generous. Rita loves

Phil was potentially stuck in that loop for ten thousand years. That's how. Danny Rubin’s original script for the film indicated that Murray’s character was forced to live the same day for 10,000 years This factoid turns 'Groundhog Day' into a pure horror movie.

Rita finds herself becoming attracted to Phil over and over as he learns more about her with each new Groundhog Day.
