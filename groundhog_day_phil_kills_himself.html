        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray. A cynical TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again when he goes on location to the small town of Punxsutawney to film a report about their annual Groundhog Day. His predicament drives him to distraction, until he sees a way of turning the situation to his advantage. Phil Connors  
Few movies achieve the level of instant recognition offered by Groundhog Day.  In desperation, Phil tries to kill himself, but even that just brings him back to the start of the day. While the  
The film Groundhog Day has become a truly timeless part of popular culture. In it, Bill Murray plays TV weatherman Phil Connors who, while covering the annual Groundhog Day event, finds himself  
He finally completely lost it. He kidnapped Punxsutawney Phil and drove a truck he stole off a cliff, with them inside. He tried various ways of killing himself. This finally led to him desperately trying to convince Rita to stay with him for the day. Phil had one more good day with her, ending it by them both tossing cards into a hat. 
Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, forced to relive the titular annual holiday forever. After Phil finds his purpose in life and becomes a better person, the curse is broken and Phil is finally freed from the time loop. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

On Phil's final Groundhog Day, Rita wins him at the Groundhog Festival auction and on their way out of the hall they run into Ned, who gleefully informs Rita that after not seeing him for 20 years  
How Long Does It Take Phil To Decide To Kill Himself? Does Phil really resort to trying to off himself as quickly as he does, simply because he is unable to get Rita to fall for him (which appears  
[Waking after a night of reading poetry and only chaste sleep with Rita, Phil jumps out of bed, determined to show himself as a new and likable man. He gives a wad of cash to the Old Man beggar and shows up early for the photo shoot, carrying a tray of coffees just the way that Rita and Larry like them, and with Larry's favorite pastry] 
Phil follows this doctrine by embracing the cycle in which he’s trapped. He learns new skills like ice sculpting, saves a kid falling out of a tree, and preoccupies himself with general do-goodery. 
Groundhog Day is a tragicomedy that uses far-fetched circumstances to explore something true to life:  Does Phil try to kill himself because he wants to end the time loop, or because he can’t

When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow.

Eventually, Phil spends such a long time giving himself pleasure that it all becomes blah and he loses the will to live. The truth is that the guy's selfishness has run out of steam and everything has started to bore him. So he decides that the best thing to do is kill himself and put an end to Groundhog Day. But nope. That doesn't work. 
This continuous ‘Groundhog Day’ eventually begins to get old for Phil. Moving into the throngs of depression, Phil decides to kill himself. Desperate to escape what has now become a nightmare for him, Phil throws himself in front of trucks, electrocutes himself and hurls himself off a building. 
The first time we see Phil kill himself is when he steals the groundhogÂ Punxsutawney Phil and drives a pickup truck off a cliff, resulting in the vehicle’s explosion. If whatever the universe is up to here was only about Phil, the next thing we would have seen would be Phil opening his eyes in bed at 6:00 a.m., starting off another day. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Driving himself (and Punxsutawney Phil, the infamous fat Groundhog rat thing) off a cliff-face, into a quarry, and a sweet fire-ball of death. But that’s just the visual stuff, Phil also confides in ‘wet weekend’ Andie MacDowell that he’s been “stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted, and burned.” Technically then, Phil  
The chase ends with Phil driving off a cliff in an attempt to kill himself, yet he still wakes up the next day in a bed and breakfast with Sonny and Cher playing on the radio. Phil spends the next few days trying different suicide methods including bathing with a toaster, getting hit by oncoming traffic, and jumping off a building. </p>
