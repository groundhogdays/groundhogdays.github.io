        <p>Window of Opportunity: Directed by Peter DeLuise. With Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c realize they and their friends are trapped in a time loop. 
Executive producer Brad Wright however noted the similarities to the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Cause and Effect", [4] and writer Robert C. Cooper suggested a lighter direction similar to the feature film Groundhog Day, [5] which O'Neill would briefly reference in the episode. [6] 
"Window of Opportunity" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of Stargate SG-1. On a routine mission to P4X-639, SG-1 meets an alien archaeologist Malakai operating an Ancient device. Malakai has his own motives and causes a time loop, where only Colonel Jack O'Neill and Teal'c notice. Furthermore, convincing the rest they are trapped in a time loop and that they have to return to the  
Specifically, Jack and Teal'c who, in past episodes, have relied on Carter and Daniel to handle the science and Ancient, and suddenly find themselves having to step into their team members' shoes. Yes, it's our version of Groundhog Day but it works because the time-loop conceit is secondary to the heart of this story: the characters. 
Groundhog Day was a popular movie on Earth involving a time loop. While trapped in a time loop by Malakai, Colonel Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was attempting to become the king of Groundhog Day. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity")

Stargate SG-1's version of Groundhog Day was thoroughly entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud frequently. Yet this episode was not the comic book that "Upgrades" was. A recurring loop of time is at least more plausible than the superhuman powers experienced by the team in "Upgrades." 
SG-1 had been on a scientific expedition to a planet undergoing major change, but a device seems to have sent them back to the start of the day. As they do this repeatedly, Teal'c and O'Neill are able to accumulate more information, eventually leading them to understand that an archaeologist, Malakai, has inadvertently created a time loop using  
Memory Wipe Exploitation: Jack and Teal'c are caught in a "Groundhog Day" Loop and eventually decide to take advantage of the lack of consequences. Ranging from using the stargate as a driving range to Jack not-quite violating the fraternization rules with Carter (he hands in his resignation first and then immediately goes to find Carter and  
Groundhog Day is a Tau'ri movie about time looping. History. Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was trying to be king of Groundhog Day after activating the Time loop machine. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity") O'Neill asked the ascended Daniel Jackson if he would stop by for Groundhog Day to which Jackson said he couldn't. (SG1: "Abyss")

It's a variation of "Groundhog Day", which is obviously not a new idea but still worked out nicely. I guess it's Col. O'Neill's dry humor and Teal'c's stoic mannerisms that really do the trick. They're stuck in a time loop and while they are trying to fix it the two of them are the only ones who remember the previous day. 
The "Groundhog Day" episode was on last week and now it's on again right now. It's one of my favorites, but twice in one week?

Stargate SG1’s was fantastic, with Col. O’Neill (“with two L’s”) and Teal’c trapped in the time loop. It’s probably my favorite. Supernatural’s was hilarious, and the one in the Librarians. 
It's not as good as a standalone episode. But when you start at episode 1 and watch right up to this one, it's a lot of fun. Besides, It's Groundhog Day in the stargate universe. Who doesn't love Groundhog Day and Stargate? 
Window of Opportunity - It's GROUNDHOG DAY for Col. O'Neill and Teal'c. While the team is investigating an artifact of the ancients on a distant planet in the company of an off-world archeologist, they notice he is acting a bit squirrelly but don't pay much attention due to the big magnetic storm going on all around them. 
Groundhog Day — Feature Film (1993): When I Iived a year in the UK, this first-run movie saved my sanity. Long story.  Season 4 of Stargate SG1 is a fantastic  </p>
