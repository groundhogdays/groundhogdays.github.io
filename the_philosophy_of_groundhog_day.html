        <h2><strong>the philosophy of groundhog day famous lines from movie groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Here's the philosophy behind this classic comedy. There's nothing better for character development than spending 10,000 years trapped in a time loop  Groundhog Day, is a charming and  
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
Philosophy classes include "Groundhog Day" in their syllabus. There was even a Broadway adaptation - "Groundhog Day: The Musical." (SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, "GROUNDHOG DAY: THE MUSICAL") 
In Groundhog Day (1993), Murray’s character, Phil Connors, finds that no matter what he does, every morning he wakes up at the same time, in the same bed, in the same hotel, in the same small American town, on the same day (February 2nd, ‘Groundhog Day’). In the subsequent twenty-four hours he is free to do anything he likes, but knows he  
The Metaphysics of Groundhog Day Lawrence Crocker says it’s about time, and personal identity, and free will. The 1993 movie Groundhog Day was, of course, made as an exploration of the metaphysics of time. The basic idea is that for on-location TV weatherman Phil Connors, the same Groundhog Day, February 2, in Punxsutawney keeps repeating. 
Groundhog Day, though simple and light-hearted on the surface, is riven with philosophical insight. Phil is not only wrestling with Nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence, he’s also playing out the Jungian concept of the shadow. It’s no coincidence that the groundhog’s called Phil too. Every day, the question is: Will Phil see his shadow? 
Michael P. Foley has a great article in Touchstone Magazine exploring some of the philosophical aspects of the movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Ranging from Nietzsche to Machiavelli and Aristotle to Augustine, Foley examines the movie from the vantage point of both philosophy and theology. Here is my favorite excerpt: 
So being forced to live a day over and over is indeed a rare way to gain some perspective on our daily lives, [4] and Groundhog Day’s suggestion, together with Aristotle, is that exercising the virtues leads to happiness because it develops our best potential, our true nature, our path to flourishing and to achieving, realizing, perfecting  
Like my experience with “Groundhog Day,” all manner of popular culture is increasingly subject to philosophical and academic examination. Harvard and other schools are studying the HBO series  
What the philosophy may not consider is that sometimes feeling pain is a good thing. For us to grow we must know what it feels like to be cut down.  Groundhog day is giving us a lesson in peace  
Lessons from "Groundhog Day": More resonant than ever today | TNews - Lessons from “Groundhog Day”: More resonant than ever today says: February 1, 2018 at 7:16 pm However ultimately it’s not, as one critic referred to as it, Phil’s now “effortless” aptitude for social gathering tips that liberates him from Punxsutawney purgatory. 
The director Harold Ramis didn't intend for his movie Groundhog Day to be heralded by religious thinkers as an example of how to live life, but that's exactly what happened after it was released in 1993. Salon reporter Mary Elizabeth Williams tells NPR's Mary Louise Kelly that after fighting cancer, she has come to understand the movie's universal message. 
Greetings everyone! I like the movie Groundhog Day, and I wouldn’t mind repeating today for a period of time. Tomorrow is a math test, and I have studied very much for it. I am working on the first two-part invention of Bach, the one in C major which is generally considered the easiest one, and am practicing hands separately and the whole bit. 
The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. 
Groundhog Day has been widely viewed and interpreted, by everyone from therapists, to Wiccans, to followers of the Chinese Falun Gong movement. In his book, How to Write Groundhog Day (2012), screenwriter Danny Rubin tells us, “The first note [after the film premiered] I remember came from a monk in Germany. 
The movie Groundhog Day is much more than just a romantic comedy; The messages to take from Groundhog Day are profoundly Stoic; The Stoicism of Groundhog Day is particularly helpful during the current pandemic; Groundhog Day Is Not Just Another Romantic Comedy. It’s easy to dismiss the movie as a likeable romantic comedy. 
There has been an increasing interest in film-philosophy as a discipline within Film Studies since the 1990s and Film-Philosophy itself has played an important role in this development. We provide an important avenue for publication in the field of film and philosophy. 
Ramis, who died in 2014, said in a short documentary about the making of “Groundhog Day” that the film reflected his philosophy of life. What Danny and I both wanted to say with the movie is  
You can listen to Hugh Breakey discuss the ethics and philosophy of “Groundhog Day” with Waleed Aly and Scott Stephens on The Minefield.. It would have been easy for an innocent audience  
In Groundhog Day, weatherman Phil Connors is a miserable human being living a life that lacks meaning. Forced to relive the same day over and over and over again  </p>
