        <h2><strong>groundhog day musical london review what year was the first groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
Groundhog Day, a new musical about a man who must experience the same day over and over until he gets it right, opens August 16 at London's Old Vic Theatre. Based on the popular 1993 film comedy  
Groundhog Day review: a simply sublime return to The Old Vic  Stephen Sondheim once thought about turning the 1993 film “Groundhog Day” into a stage musical. He gave up on the idea, saying  
London Theater Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ the Musical Old Vic Theatre, London; 1,200 seats; £59.50 ($87.50) top. Opened, reviewed Aug. 16th, 2016. 
A musical as miraculous as the events which enfold within it, Groundhog Day is the best screen-to-stage adaptation since Matilda.

Groundhog Day – The Old Vic, London June 21, 2023 June 20, 2023 5 mins Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin take on beloved 90s film Groundhog Day in a return of their musical version at the Old Vic. Funny, heartfelt and endlessly rewatchable, I may like it better than the original. 
Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London. With music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus, Groundhog Day has a book by Danny Ruben, who co-wrote the screenplay of the original movie, which starred Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. 
The even more unusual repeat action here is that largely the same principal creative team behind Matilda the Musical have managed to create another huge hit -- and while the earlier show concerned the growing pains of a pre-teen girl who was more adult than her years, the new one concerns an adult brat of a television weatherman called Phil  
Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage.
