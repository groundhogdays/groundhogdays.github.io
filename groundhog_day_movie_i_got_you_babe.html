        <p>It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? 
Every alarm clock sequence in Groundhog Day. 
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day reimagines Punxsutawney as a contemporary version of the sleepy hamlets and simple people that Frank Capra and Preston Sturges celebrated in their classic films of the 1930s and 1940s. Even Needle-Nosed Ned, the insurance agent played by the great Stephen Tobolowsky in the role he will be remembered for, seems like a nice guy.

He plows through the day, feigning interest in the event when he's on camera, but showing no regard for his co-workers and total disdain for the citizens of Punxsutawney. The next day, he wakes up in the same room, once again at 6:00 a.m., and once again with "I Got You Babe" playing on the radio. 
Bill Murray is awakened to,” I Got You Babe,” every morning at precisely 6:00 a.m. on the alarm clock. The movie grew a huge cult of fans that watched it every February 2. “I Got You Babe” became part of the Groundhog Day tradition. The song was so popular it was re-released in 1993 and it re-entered the music charts.
