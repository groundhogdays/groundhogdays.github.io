The Cherry Tree Inn has one too!Look for the Groundhog Day plaque on the arch as you walk to the front of the home. Final Thoughts of Cherry Tree Inn 
Groundhog Day movie house lives in our hearts along with Bill Murray who woke up repeating the same day over and over again until he got it right; we all would like a do-over. Many scenes from the Groundhog Day movie were filmed in Woodstock, IL where this home resides at 344 Fremont St. 
The Groundhog Day Ceremony was recorded on Woodstock Town Square, near the gazebo. The Northen Federal Savings Bank is the Chase Bank at 118 Cass Street. Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is a real-life town, hosting the annual Groundhog Day since the 1800s. The event is attended every year by thousands of visitors from around the world. 
At first, Harold Ramis‚Äô GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray‚Äôs sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity.

The following year, 1887, marked the first official Groundhog Day event at Gobbler‚Äôs Knob. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, formed in 1899, further popularized the tradition. 
The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There‚Äôs a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‚ÄòPunxsutawney, Pa‚Äô to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
Ever since the making of Groundhog Day in 1992, each year Woodstock residents still get together to celebrate Groundhog Day. Woodstock has its own Groundhog Day festival, complete with a dinner dance, free showings of the movie, and a walking tour of some of the sites where the movie was filmed. THE TIP TOP CAFE
