        <p>Groundhog Science Activities: Shadow Experiments. I love shadow science experiments! All you need is some light and an object — any object. Experiment #1: Take kids outside and ask them if they see their shadow. Talk to kids about what creates a shadow (light and any object blocking the light). 
Did you know that on Groundhog Day, people across the country watch for the prediction of winter’s length based on whether a groundhog sees its shadow?Groundhog Day originates from an old superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will return to its den, signifying that winter will continue for an additional six weeks. 
Groundhog Day isn’t just about predicting the weather; it’s a great opportunity to explore the fascinating world of shadows with our young learners. This blog post is a series of STEAM activities designed for preschoolers to understand and experiment with light and shadows. 
Groundhog Day is celebrated every February 2nd, and it’s the perfect time to connect kids to the science of Groundhogs. 3 topics are perfect for connecting Groundhog Day with STEM: Weather. Habitats. Light and Shadows. 1. Connect Groundhogs and Weather. Do your students have what it takes to be a part of the Groundhog Weather School? 
10 Easy Science Experiments: Shadow &amp; Light Activities. Groundhog’s Day is actually one of my favorite mini-holidays but not for the reason you think. Yes, I do enjoy science and all but more importantly, it was the day my husband &amp; I first met. 
Before completing the activity review the following vocabulary words with students: light, shadow, opaque, transparent, and translucent. Vocabulary cards are included in our Groundhog Day STEM Activity Pack along with in-depth teacher instructions, student instructions, prediction pages, recording pages, and reflection pages. 
If he saw his shadow, he will return to his burrow and there will be 6 more weeks of winter weather. We will have a second winter. If he doesn’t see his shadow, then spring is on it’s way. I found a great article on Groundhog Day in Canada and the USA here. Groundhog Day Activities Supplies. Soda pop bottles Balloons 
Groundhog Day Activities – Shadow Experiment. Your Groundhog Day activities wouldn't be complete without learning about shadows so we did a fun shadow detective experiment. You'll need a sunny day for this activity. I took the students outside and each person chose a partner. 
Then we talked about different ways shadows are made by the sun, like her shadow outside was when her body blocks the sunlight. Finally, we talked about how a tree’s shadow makes shade when the tree blocks the sunlight. The pizza was almost done cooking so I showed the kids this great video about Groundhog’s Day. 
Family-Friendly Groundhog Day Events and Activities • Attend a local Groundhog Day event. Many towns host their own Groundhog Day celebrations where families can witness a live groundhog making its prediction. • Conduct the shadow experiment. On Groundhog Day, go outside with your children and observe your shadows. 
Will the groundhog see its shadow? With this adorable groundhog shadow art project, you’ll decide! This craft is perfect for celebrating Groundhog Day with a creative twist, and it’s super easy to make. Using simple materials and a dash of imagination, you’ll create a charming groundhog scene that’s as fun to craft as it is to display. 
Groundhog Shadow Craft | Easy Groundhog Day idea for kids. Use a free printable PDF template at daycare, school, or for homeschool! Fun fine motor practice. 
Groundhog Day Science Experiment: Shadow Puppets. Predicting the weather based on a groundhog’s shadow isn’t very scientific. But our children can have fun experimenting with lights and shadows and learn something about God’s light as well! 
We did this fun Groundhog Day science activity a few years ago, and it was such a great learning activity! With tomorrow being the big day—Groundhog Day, that is—I thought I would share it with you one more time so you can try it out! I shared the setup of the activity in this blog 
QUICK HISTORY OF GROUNDHOG DAY. Groundhog Day falls on February 2nd, otherwise known as Candlemas Day. This fury rodent made his grand debut in 1887 in Gobbler’s Knob (Punxsutawney, PA). Candlemas falls halfway between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox. 
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow.

The educational activities and shadow science experiments for kids listed above are a hands-on way to learn about shadows, the sun, and the science of light, and that makes most of these activities perfect for Groundhog’s Day on February second, or year-round fun. 
Shadow puppet play is a great addition to Groundhog Day STEM activities, but it also works well for learning about diurnal and nocturnal animals. Try creating puppets of animals that are active during the day (diurnal) versus those active at night (nocturnal), and use them to teach kids about the day and night cycle. Light and Shadow
