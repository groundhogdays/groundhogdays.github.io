Groundhog Day 1993 Director: Harold Ramis Stars: Bill Murray , Andie MacDowell , Robin Duke , Chris Elliott , Willie Garson Genre: Comedy , Drama , Fantasy Rating: PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) Runtime: 101 minutes 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone.

Hope to post more about them, the poets, and poetry news soon. Meanwhile, I thought it might be fun to stop and celebrate the upcoming Groundhog Day (I love that Bill Murray movie). So, here we go.
