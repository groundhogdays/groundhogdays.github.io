        <h2><strong>how long did the movie groundhog day last super bowl commercial groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
Ever since the movie "Groundhog Day" was released in 1993, fans have wondered how long Bill Murray's character was forced to relive February 2nd. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
I may have seen the movie 20-odd times and still wouldn't know the answer to your question. Time and time again I marvel at what may be the reason the loop ends and find different answers each time. 
This brings us back to the original question: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day?. Originally, the film's director, Harold Ramis, stated that he thought Bill's character was trapped in Punxsutawney for about 10 years. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
Phil's reaction at the end of the movie is pretty unbelievable anyway. Even if it was decades he probably would've had a total emotional breakdown to finally move past groundhog day. Specially when he couldn't even end it through death. In the movie he just seems to be mildly surprised that it's ended and carries on like nothing much happened. 
“According to the screenwriter, there are multiple answers. The studio says 2 weeks. [] According to him, it's over a lifetime.” That’s not what I get from the quote at all!
