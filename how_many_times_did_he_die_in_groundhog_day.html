        <h2><strong>how many times did he die in groundhog day radio quote from groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? Well, there are 38 days actually shown on screen, as well as 414 days mentioned in the film and a huge 11,931 days which Phil spends learning a host of new talents and interests - based on the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray. A cynical TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again when he goes on location to the small town of Punxsutawney to film a report about their annual Groundhog Day. His predicament drives him to distraction, until he sees a way of turning the situation to his advantage. Phil Connors  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
According to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper was in 1886. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler's Knob, and the tradition has continued in the same fashion every year ever since. Happy Groundhog Day! 
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  
Groundhog day Massacre! 99 ways to die.  It's been estimated that 38 separate days were shown in the film, not that he "repeated Groundhog Day 38 times." The  
It is not directly stated in the movie and there are plenty of days that happened off-screen, making counting by viewers impossible. However this same question was asked over on the Movies &amp; TV Stack Exchange site and it was stated that there were 160 days in the book that the movie is based on. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
I don't know much about this movie, but what I can tell you is that in the movie "Groundhog Day" staring Bill Murray as a journalist who relives the same day over and over, I remember reading somewhere a long time ago that someone calculated how long it would take for him to learn all the things Bill Murray's character learned throughout the movie, and it was something like 40, or 50 years. 
Not only is 1993's Groundhog Day considered one of Bill Murray's best films ever, but it's also widely regarded as one of the finest comedies to come out of the 1990s. It's the perfect blend of  
How many times did Bill Murray wake up in Groundhog Day? Well a film blog has worked it out for you: 33 years and 350 days. WhatCulture.com worked out just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film’s 20th anniversary. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
To celebrate Groundhog Day 2016, we take a look back at the classic Bill Murray film and discover how many days his character actually spent in the movie  he’s seen repeating the day 38 times  
Bring its own unique spin to the Groundhog Day time-travel trope, Edge of Tomorrow almost unfolds like a live-action video game where its main character keeps respawning at a checkpoint every time he dies. Like every character stuck in a time loop, he takes time to figure out what is happening. However, when he finally does, the stakes of his  </p>
