        <p>Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical.Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy.

Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
As per the classic 1993 film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day takes place on a very big day in a very small Pennsylvanian town. Each year on February 2, a large rodent emerges from his burrow  
Paramount Theater has become one of the highest ranked regional theater companies and that is why we get to see some Midwest premiers on their stage. “Groundhog Day: the Musical” will continue at The Paramount located at 23 East Galena Blvd in Aurora through March 13th with performances as follows: Wednesdays 1:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. 
Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
MUSICAL THEATRE Groundhog Day the Musical ★★★★ Princess Theatre, Melbourne, until April 7 Naturally, I’d have to see the Groundhog Day musical over and over to write the perfect review. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Beginning life as a musical in 2016, at London’s Old Vic Theatre, Groundhog Day won an Olivier Award for Best New Musical, and a Critics’ Circle Theatre Award for Best Musical. 
Newsday called it “an ingenious, witty, joyously offbeat musical.” NY1 said “Danny Rubin’s wryly humorous book and Tim Minchin’s clever songs, the forecast for this Groundhog Day looks pretty bright!” Groundhog Day was a New York Times Critics Pick and the Washington Post said “The surprises are consistently amazing!” 
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. 
In addition to Groundhog Day, Theatre 121’s 2024-2025 season features a diverse lineup of productions, including A Christmas Story (November 15 – December 1, 2024), The Three Musketeers (April 4-13, 2025), and The Prom (June 20-29, 2025).

Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl. 
GROUNDHOG DAY: THE MUSICAL MARCH 20-APRIL 5, 2025. Groundhog Day brings the beloved film classic to vibrant life on stage with an enchanting blend of humor, romance, and heartwarming songs. Follow the journey of Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman trapped in a time loop, reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. 
Broadway Review: ‘Groundhog Day,’ The Musical August Wilson Theater; 1228 seats; $159 top. Opened April 17, 2017. Reviewed April 13.  Nikki Glaser on Hosting the 2025 Golden Globes  
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
As already mentioned the tkts booth sells discount tickets. For Groundhog Day, the tickets tend to be 40-50% always. You can buy same day tickets at Times Square, and next day matinee tickets at Lincoln center Seaport, and Brooklyn. However, the way I got to see Groundhog Day at a ridiculously cheap price was by entering the lottery.
