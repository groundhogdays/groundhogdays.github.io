        <p>PUNXSUTAWNEY, PA - FEBRUARY 02: Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil climbs on the top hat of his handler after Phil did not see his shadow and predicting an early spring during the 127th Groundhog Day  
During the 25-year anniversary of the movie's release, Murray's Groundhog Day co-star Andie MacDowell (who plays producer Rita Hanson) spoke to TheWrap about her experiences filming — including  
The movie was filmed during a tough time. One of the main reasons Murray hated Groundhog Day had nothing to do with the movie itself. During filming, the actor was going through a divorce from his  
Groundhog Day is not known as a controversial movie. ‘90s movies like Basic Instinct and Kids were. But, 1993, Groundhog Day attracted religious groups, fortunately in a good way. 
Jon Mikel Caballero, director of the Spanish movie The Incredible Shrinking Wknd (2019), features in the book with a final interview, as does the screenwriter of Groundhog Day, Danny Rubin. The Californian playwright says that the idea for the story came to him from the novel The Vampire Lestat (1985), by Anne Rice. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
The annual tradition became more widely known through the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day" that showed if given enough time even someone like Bill Murray could meet a woman like Andie MacDowell. People who watched the movie still sing the Sonny and Cher song ‘I Got You Babe’ every now and then. 
The great writer, director, and actor Stephen Tobolowsky (Ned in ‘Groundhog Day’) joins John Williams to talk about the iconic film and the festivities the city of Woodstock (where the movie was filmed) has planned for Groundhog Day this year. Stephen recalls some of the scenes in the movie, the comedic partnership with Bill Murray, some  
But it’s Groundhog Day again, and the 1993 movie bearing that name is among my favorites, so I’ll take the liberty just this once. Or maybe it’s not such a departure from business as usual, as a quick glance around the internet shows that I’m not alone among conservative columnists in my love for the film. 
Without a doubt, Groundhog Day is the superior movie when comparing it to Scrooged. The 1993 film is more unique and shows off the actor's dramatic talents while including his comedic chops. Groundhog Day is the perfect balance of drama and comedy and is regarded as one of Murray's best projects (and one of the best movies of the 1990s). 
107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same.

Controversial. Old. Q&amp;A. MisterJellyfis  Before I fall. Cheesy teen groundhog day movie. Reply reply BenR2024  
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
What Two Distant Strangers and Groundhog Day for a Black Man do share is an unabashed debt to Groundhog Day. Danny Rubin, the writer of that 1993 film, said he was unaware of this recent controversy, and hadn’t seen either short. But he said he was “delighted by all of the permutations” of his film’s concept. 
This is a reference to the character from the hit movie Groundhog Day, who's main character is named Phil.  The Movie Black Panther (2018) caused controversy when

Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
Groundhog Day style movies are not new, and in this instance, the Netflix short also drew comparisons to a couple of other titles too. The Netflix short shares a similar plot to an episode of the rebooted The Twilight Zone with an episode called Replay released in 2019. It’s also similar to the 2019 movie The Obituary of Tunde Johnson. </p>
