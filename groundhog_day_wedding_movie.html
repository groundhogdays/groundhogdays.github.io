The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development.

The entire time loop subgenre of sci-fi movies owes itself to Groundhog Day, including Palm Springs. When two wedding guests (played by Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti) discover that they're both stuck living the same day over and over again, first panic sets in—then, boredom. 
Palm Springs is a fun time loop comedy. Mainly because it assumes that the audience is familiar with the Groundhog Day concept so it hits the ground running. Nyles (Andy Samberg ) has been reliving the same day for ages. He goes to the wedding each day of a friend of his live in girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner) who is also cheating on him.
