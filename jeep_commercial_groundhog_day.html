Dive back into the beloved world of 'Groundhog Day' with Bill Murray in the extended Jeep 2020 Super Bowl commercial, a nostalgic and hilarious revisit to on 
Jeep's Extended Bill Murray 'Groundhog Day' Super Bowl Ad And Behind The Scenes Footage From The Production Of The Commercial.Bill Murray agreed to reprise t 
This was as much an homage to "Groundhog Day," 28 years later, as it was a commercial for Jeep. It was as much a tribute to the movie's fans as it was a pitch to buy a pickup truck. 
Persuading Murray to reprise his role came down to a chance meeting, a lengthy letter and surprise call two weeks before the game. 
It was d√©j√† vu all over again. For Super Bowl LIV, Jeep rolled out a commercial starring Bill Murray reprising his role as TV weatherman Phil Connors from the beloved 1993 film ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚Äù 
Jeep: Groundhog Day: Directed by Jim Jenkins. With Justin Campbell, Brian Doyle-Murray, Kevin Lingle, Bill Murray. In Jeep's Super Bowl commercial: Bill Murray and other original Groundhog's Day cast members reenact scenes from the movie, only the Bill's character now uses a Jeep to go on outings with the ground hog. 
The commercial was filmed over three days in Woodstock, Illinois, and only finished up on Jan. 26. The town was also the same location where the original movie was shot. But it also almost didn‚Äôt happen. Francois realized last fall that the Super Bowl and Groundhog Day would be occurring on the same day for only the second time in 54 years. 
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù all over again as Jeep brand debuts a Big Game spot starring Bill Murray (in his first-ever national television commercial). But this time reliving the same day over and over again is always a new adventure when you‚Äôre driving the 2020 Jeep Gladiator. 
The idea? reprising his role as Phil Connors from the 1993 film ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚Äù Murray did it, perhaps reluctantly, because he said it was his first and final appearance in a national commercial. If that is the case, he went out on top. Jeep won the 2020 Ad Meter crown for the best ad during that year‚Äôs Big Game. 
You're welcome again, Internet!

The Jeep ¬Æ brand‚Äôs 2020 Super Bowl commercial ‚ÄúGroundhog Day,‚Äù starring Bill Murray and featuring the 2020 Jeep Gladiator truck, is the Big Game‚Äôs most viewed commercial across social media (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). 
For Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief marketing officer Olivier Fran√ßois, that posed a challenge when he was hit with the idea for a commercial mirroring Murray‚Äôs 1993 film, Groundhog Day, since  
And lucky enough for Jeep, a cherry on top: Murray confirmed himself via news release it will be his first and last commercial he‚Äôll ever star in. An all-around winning day for the brand at that Super Bowl. Have another look at the extended version of Jeep‚Äôs winning commercial below:
