        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
How did Groundhog Day come to be? The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania . The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner.

MACON, Ga. — Groundhog Day has been an annual tradition since the very first celebration was held on Feb. 2nd, 1877 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If the groundhog sees its shadow, there is six  
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
Groundhog Day fans aren’t able to arrive at the official “Gobbler’s Knob” grounds until they open at 3 a.m. ET. Since the holiday has evolved over time, Groundhog Day activities don’t just end after Phil makes his predictions. In fact, celebratory events continue throughout the rest of the week — including the Groundhog Ball on Feb. 3. 
As the sun rose on Groundhog Day today, the region’s top furry forecasters all agreed that an early spring is on the horizon. While modern meteorologists may put more faith in weather satellites  
T o the unfamiliar, Groundhog Day is perhaps one of America’s quirkiest traditions. Every Feb. 2, people wait for a large, furry rodent to see his shadow, and then predict the weather based on  
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
A peculiar holiday in the beginning of February brings a myriad of people together and has as its main attraction an adorable, furry forecaster. Every Feb. 2, Punxsutawney Phil comes out of  
Groundhog Day Announcer: Our buddy, Punxsutawney Phil! As the tradition goes, every year on February 2, Phil the groundhog comes out of his hole in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If he sees his  
The first recorded mention of Groundhog Day in America dates back to 1841 when it appeared in a diary entry by James Morris. However, it wasn’t until February 2nd, 1887 when a newspaper editor named Clymer H. Freas from Punxsutawney declared Punxsutawney Phil as the official weather-forecasting groundhog. 
So when they start crawling out of their burrows and looking for mates, it means that winter and the bad weather is almost over. And there’s the connection! The First Groundhog’s Day in America. When German immigrants started settling in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries, they naturally brought their customs with them. 
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
Groundhog Day began as a tiny event and has grown into an American holiday we can all be proud of. Its furry, buck-toothed star, Punxsutawney Phil, has visited the White House and even met Oprah. 
The Legacy of "Groundhog Day" (1993) The popularity of Groundhog Day skyrocketed in 1993 with the release of the movie "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again in Punxsutawney.
