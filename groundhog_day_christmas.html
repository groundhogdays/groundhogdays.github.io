See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

Groundhog Day, celebrated every year on February 2, is an unusual holiday that stretches back hundreds of years back to European traditions and even ancient times. How is Groundhog Day Celebrated? Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of  
The surprising history of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil's rise to fame goes back thousands of years.  This feast day, called Candlemas, falls 40 days after Christmas, marking the end of  
Groundhog Day is the 1st cross-quarter day of the year. Image via weather.gov.  It’s supposed to be bad luck to leave your Christmas decorations up after Groundhog Day. 
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
America has been looking to Punxsutawney Phil for over 130 years to indicate whether or not we'll have a short or long winter. But Groundhog Day goes back way further than that. Here's the complete history of the holiday, as well as when it is and how Punxsutawney Phil came to be.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
I sometimes straddle two equally unattractive options as the clock counts down to Christmas. First is the temptation of boredom in having to do the same thing again  and again (think Bill Murray in Groundhog Day or Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow). 
If Rowena's attitude had shifted earlier in the repeating Groundhog Day-esque plot of this Disney Channel movie, this movie could have had the potential to be a Christmas classic. Instead, Rowena's bratty, self-centered behavior in the majority of ' Christmas Again?! ' adds a bit of bah-humbug to the sweet ending. 
Most holidays fall into two categories: Those honoring historical events or people (Independence Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Mothers Day, Fathers Day, MLK Day) or religious events/people (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, St. Patrick's Day, even Mardi Gras [the day before Ash Wednesday] and Halloween [the day before All Saints Day]). </p>
