        <h2><strong>how does groundhog day actually work cast groundhog day musical</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
If the groundhog does not see its shadow, the prediction is that there will be an early spring.  How does Groundhog Day actually work? Published: Feb. 01, 2022, 3:19 p.m. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here.

It was immortalized in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, which was actually shot in Woodstock, Illinois. How Accurate Are Groundhogs? While sunny winter days are indeed associated with colder, drier  
When is Groundhog Day 2024? Groundhog Day will take place Friday, Feb. 2, 2024. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 3 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow on Feb. 2 each year.

Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. The ceremony itself — which returned to the stage in 2022 after a COVID-19 hiatus — features dancers, music, speeches and visitors from around the world.

Punxsutawney Phil's process for predicting spring hasn't changed much in the past 137 years. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club takes care of Phil year-round, and on each Feb. 2, members of the club

Spring officially starts 20 March but depending whether or not a groundhog sees its shadow, it’s believed to foretell how soon spring weather will arrive.
