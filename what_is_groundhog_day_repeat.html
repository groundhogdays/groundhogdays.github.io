        <h2><strong>what is groundhog day repeat groundhog day on tv tonight</strong></h2>
        <p>To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently. 
Even those who have never seen “Groundhog Day” are familiar with the film’s premise. The protagonist, Bill Murray’s Phil, is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over. He attempts to escape the loop by changing something important, becoming familiar with the events that happen along the way and eventually growing as a  
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
Here we go again: Time loop stories were around long before the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. So a friendly reminder that one person's discovery of something isn't the same as its invention. 
As you may or may not know, today is Groundhog Day and it's as good a time as any to revisit what many call Bill Murray's finest on-screen comedic performance t 
No, Groundhog Day is not based on a true story. It is a work of fiction written by Danny Rubin. 2. How many times does Phil Connors repeat Groundhog Day? Although it is never explicitly mentioned, it is estimated that Phil repeats Groundhog Day for approximately 10,000 days. 3. Does Phil Connors remember each day he repeats? 
Either way, today is Groundhog Day and in the 1993 film of the same name, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to live the same day over and over again, improving himself a little bit each and  
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring. DamianKuzdak/Getty Images Places like Missouri, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  
The arts have also used repetition as the driving force behind powerful narratives. The most popular example is the movie “Groundhog Day”, where a character finds himself inexplicably repeating the same day over and over again. Other movies about repetition and time loops include: “Run, Lola, Run” and “Palm Springs”. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The outdated day gained modern fame from the 1993 movie “Groundhog Day,” where Bill Murray wakes up to repeat the same day over and over. Why in the world do I need a reminder of this useless day? 
The Little Charmers episode "A Charming Do Over" has Hazel casting a spell to repeat a day at a magic carnival in an attempt to win a crystal ball, which repeats until the other Charmers get sick of it. The Littlest Pet Shop (2012) episode "In the Loop" sees Russell stuck in one. And the guest in the daycamp for that repeated day is a groundhog. 
The only element of Groundhog day that is not 'real' is the time loop, so it is closer to magical realism than sci-fi or fantasy as it is applying some magical concepts to a real world setting. In addition, the focus on repetition and its consequences is similar to a lot of work by Jorge Luis Borges, a prominent magical realist. 
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
Run Lola Run utilizes a time loop structure where the protagonist navigates varying outcomes of repeated events, mirroring Groundhog Day 's exploration of cause and effect within a single day. The urgency and innovative storytelling ensure that each repetition brings new insights and excitement, maintaining engagement in a manner similar to the  
Groundhog Day isn't the first movie to experiment with the concept of a time loop.But it undoubtedly is the most influential, so much so that every subsequent time-loop movie would inevitably have
