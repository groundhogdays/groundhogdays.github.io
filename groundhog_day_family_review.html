Flesh Wound Farce is back, and just in time for the holiday we discuss and review the Harold Raimis classic comedy GROUNDHOG DAY starring Bill Murray.SUPPORT 
Don't get me wrong - I was expecting a complete rip-off of Groundhog Day with Amy Smart as the protagonist, reliving Christmas Eve &amp; all the complications of rekindling an ex-love, a blind date as well as other friendships along the way.
