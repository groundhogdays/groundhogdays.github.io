Spoilers for 'Agents of SHIELD' Season 7 Episode 9 'As I Have Always Been'. 'Agents of SHIELD' Season 7 is inching closer to the end but with Episode 9 'As I Have Always Been', the show takes a break from the main storyline for what is probably the most powerful filler episode we've ever seen.

Agents of SHIELD season 7 has consistently found new twists to put on various episodes, like the noir tale found in episode 4 and last week's 80s homage-filled installment.

Many shows will inevitably have the groundhog day type episodes during their run. and I was surprised it took Shield this long to have such an episode. But now that it's finally aired it certainly did not disappoint. This will go down as one of , if not the best episode in the series. Elizabeth's directoral debut is nothing to look over either.

A popular tradition in the United States, Groundhog Day is also a legend that traverses centuries, its origins clouded in the mists of time with ethnic cultures and animals awakening on specific dates. 
The Agents Of SHIELD one was absolutely fantastic, and pretty funny. It knows its audience, knows the audience knows these episodes, and does things a bit differently or amusingly. But I quite like Red Dwarf's riff on them in Future Echoes. 
Marvel's Agents of SHIELD throws our team into a time loop in this week's episode. Can the team break out of it or will they be forever trapped? </p>
