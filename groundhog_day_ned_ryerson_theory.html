        <p>Groundhog Day's Time Loop Begins With Ned Ryerson According to the theory, the time loop begins the first time Phil runs into Ned and is intended to get him to sign a contract. They're supposedly friends from high school, but Phil doesn’t recognize him, thinking the man is a fan instead. 
Groundhog Day's status as one of the best romantic comedies of all time means that occasionally, the depth of its fantastical element - the time loop - is overlooked. The theory goes that Ned Ryerson is actually the embodiment of the Devil, and that he deliberately traps Phil in the time loop as a form of punishment. 
One dark interpretation of "Groundhog Day" adds a lot more weight to Phil Connors' interaction with Ned Ryerson, layering in a supernatural element. 
In this episode of Film Theory, we dive deep into the enigmatic character of Ned Ryerson in the classic film Groundhog Day, and explore the fascinating theor 
A Redditor mentioned this a while back: The theory is that Ned Ryerson is actually the devil, and that Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors signs his soul over to Ned in order to get out of the  
That's right, Groundhog Day's Devil is, in fact, Ned Ryerson. Needle Nose Ned. The theory suggests that Phil is trapped in Punxsutawney because he insults Ned and turns down his offer of a  
Groundhog Day sees Ned Ryerson's Devil trap Bill Murray's Phil Connors in a time loop, according to a popular fan theory. By George Simpson , Senior Film and Arts Reporter 11:55, Wed, Jan 1, 2025  
Reportedly, Beelzebub appears in the family-friendly film in the form of an unsuspecting insurance salesman by the name of Ned Ryerson. For the uninitiated few, Groundhog Day centres around a despondent and fairly unlikeable weather presenter, played by Bill Murray, by the name of Phil Connors. The presenter is forced to travel to Punxsutawney  
Happy Groundhog Day! I'd like to take this time to outline a theory I have about Ned Ryerson from the 1993 movie Groundhog Day: there is evidence that Ned Ryerson has also been experiencing the same day on repeat. Ned Ryerson (portrayed hilariously by Stephen Toblowsky) is an insurance salesman who approaches Phil on the 
GROUNDHOG DAY sees Ned Ryerson's devil trap Bill Murray in a time loop, according to a popular fan theory. By George Simpson , Senior Film and Arts Reporter 15:16, Mon, Feb 3, 2020 | UPDATED: 16:  
One of the most memorable scenes in the film, you may recall, involves Phil bumping into an old acquaintance on his walk into town on that first Groundhog Day morning. That man is Ned Ryerson. You know, NED RYERSON. Needlenose Ned, Ned the Head, Case Western High alumnus who did the whistling belly-button trick at the talent show? 
The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is fully able to enjoy. Secondly: On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. 
In my theory the first interaction with the alarm clock is just the start of a normal day. Had he not interacted with Ned he never would've experienced that moment with the alarm clock again. So I'm saying on the first day Ned damns Phil to continually start that day over and over, and he takes his first step into his cursed life. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
Groundhog Day never really ends, it’s a parasite that gets passed from person to person. That’s my theory. Let Me explain: There’s a theory on reddit that Phil Connors is in hell/purgatory and that Ned Ryerson is/was the devil (need link). This video covers that idea but doesn’t link the post. I remember reading it years ago here too. 
This "Groundhog Day" Fan Theory Is So Dark, Holy Shit.  Ned Ryerson is an insurance salesman, and on Phil's last day in the time loop, he actually buys life insurance from Ned. 
Also, I don’t think that Ned Ryerson lives in Punxsutawney. We see him on Groundhog Day when most of the other folks in town are just visiting and he shows up at the end of the film at the big Groundhog dinner party, leading me to believe he’s in town specifically for Groundhog Day. 
The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is able to enjoy. Secondly: On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. 
Basically, the assumption is that Ned has run through 500 times already when Phil starts his Groundhog Day, and Phil's day constantly overwrites Ned's 501st day. This would explain why Ned's actions are slightly different on the days that Phil acts wildly differently. 
Ned? Ned Ryerson?. You have to admit that Groundhog Day, the 1993 film starring Bill Murray (which he hated) and Andie MacDowell (who we haven't heard from in awhile), hits different this year.A  </p>
