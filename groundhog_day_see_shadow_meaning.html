Groundhog handler AJ Derume holds Punxsutawney Phil, who saw his shadow, predicting a late spring during the 136th annual Groundhog Day festivities on February 2, 2022 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General Beauregard Lee of Atlanta, Dunkirk Dave of Dunkirk, New York, and Jimmy of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. 
The focus of many was on Gobbler's Knob in tiny Pennsylvania town, Punxsutawney, on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024 as the weather prognosticating groundhog Phil sees, or doesn't see, his shadow. How did all  
However, if the groundhog does see his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter rather than above average temperatures, according to legend. Forecast for 7 a.m. Sunday morning in
