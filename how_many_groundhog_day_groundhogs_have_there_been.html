Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
Manitoba Merv has been forecasting since the 1990s, at Oak Hammock Marsh. [106] Winnipeg Wyn has been forecasting since the 2010s, at Prairie Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. [107] Balzac Billy is the "Prairie Prognosticator", a man-sized groundhog mascot who prognosticates weather on Groundhog Day from Balzac, Alberta. [108] 
Years later, another incident occurred. During a 2014 Groundhog Day ceremony, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped the animal, who had been secretly replaced with his granddaughter Charlotte.

Germans watched for badgers to cast shadows; the Pennsylvania Germans chose the groundhog as a "replacement." The first official celebration of Groundhog Day was on February 2, 1886 - and Punxsutawney Phil didn't see his shadow. Phil has seen his shadow 98 times, hasn't seen it 15 times, and there are no records for ten years. 
The Stormfax Almanac has made note of the weather conditions on each Groundhog Day since 1999; the almanac has recorded 12 incidents in a 20-year span in which the Inner Circle said the groundhog saw his shadow while the sky was cloudy or there was rain or snow coming down, and in one case said the groundhog did not see his shadow despite

Groundhog Day began as a tiny event and has grown into an American holiday we can all be proud of. Its furry, buck-toothed star, Punxsutawney Phil, has visited the White House and even met Oprah.
