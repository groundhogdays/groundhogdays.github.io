        <p>The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring. DamianKuzdak/Getty Images Places like Missouri, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
In the Fall of 2016, The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club worked with Discovery Studios and Animal planet to create a one hour documentary called: A Groundhog Day Story: The Tale of a Marmot, His Shadow, and the People Who Protect Him. This special aired on Groundhog Day, February 2nd 2017 on the Animal Planet network! 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray. In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd. 
The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day. Despite its roots in superstition and folklore, Groundhog Day has endured as a beloved tradition for over 130 years. Its popularity speaks to the human need for levity, hope, and communal celebration, especially during the long, dark days of winter. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. The ceremony itself — which returned to the stage in 2022 after a COVID-19 hiatus — features dancers, music, speeches and visitors from around the world. 
Has anyone ever experienced Groundhog Day I just watched the movie with Bill Murray and thought to myself, has anyone ever gone through the same experience. Obviously the first answer would be no, but I wanna know if there's some wild case where the person told people that they were stuck or had experienced the same day over and over again. 
The emotionally taxing journey proved harder than anyone could have dreamed.  the only other woodchuck in New Jersey with any Groundhog Day experience. 
Every February 2nd is Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Each year, one of America’s strangest traditions occurs as Punxsutawney Phil, a weather-predicting groundhog, is pulled out of his temporary burrow at Gobbler’s Knob to get his prediction of the weather for the coming weeks.

From despair to acceptance. And that’s putting it mildly. If someone were to have a Groundhog Day experience like in the movie, they would endure emotional fatigue. This alone would create a challenge in the area of managing their mental well-being. Here’s 7 action items we can put to use TODAY to deal with our own Groundhog Day experiences. 
A Groundhog Club handler holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather-prognosticating groundhog, during the 133rd celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2, 2019. 
Here what you really have to do is call a sinkhole repair company and have them pump in sinkhole grout, they have experience and do a fair job of clean up after. Should not be more than a few hundred dollars. 
In groundhog day, I don't think we ever have a reason to believe anyone but Phil is aware of the resets. Everything but Phil's consciousness is restored to exactly how they were when the alarm woke Phil the first time. In one episode of Stargate this happened. Teal'c and McNeil were caught in a groundhog day loop. 
I'm in this surreal headspace that kind of feels like groundhog day. Every day I get up at 8.30, poop, start my laptop at 9 to check emails, shower, join a call at 9.30. From 10 I listen to the same radio station and do all my daily work jobs.
