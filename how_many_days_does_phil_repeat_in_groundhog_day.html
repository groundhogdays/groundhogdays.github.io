        <p>Which, in turn, means it's time to ask the question that has sat in the minds of viewers since 1993: How many times does weatherman Phil Connors repeat the same day in his purgatorial Punxsutawney? 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
In the DVD commentary for Groundhog Day, director Harold Ramis actually stated that Bill Murray’s character was stuck living the same day on repeat for 10 years, but that answer was evidently unsatisfying for certain fans of the film. 
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395 times. 
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
So just how much of those 10,000 years did Phil spend trapped in a loop? According to WhatCulture, Phil only spent 33 years and 350 days repeating the same day over and over again, or 12,395 times to be exact. P.S. In case you were wondering, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow earlier today, and so we get an early spring! 
WhatCulture.com worked out just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film’s 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the torturous time equates to repeating the same day 12,395 times. 
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  
How many days does Groundhog Day repeat? In the Groundhog Day movie, the main character relives the same day repeatedly, but the exact number of days is never specified. "Groundhog Day" revolves around a time loop where the main character, Phil Connors, relives the same day repeatedly.
