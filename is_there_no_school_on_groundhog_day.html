        <h2><strong>is there no school on groundhog day alarm clock song in groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Yes. Groundhog day (Feb 2nd) is not a holiday. Unless Groundhog days falls on a Saturday or Sunday then there is school. 
The short answer is, it depends. Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd, is a unique holiday that is usually not observed as a federal or state holiday. This means that schools and businesses usually operate as usual. However, some schools and institutions may choose to celebrate Groundhog Day with special activities or events. 
But this year, we all were feeling a little blah about the 100th day, so we decided as a team to celebrate the 101st day of school! So Friday will be learning about Groundhogs and a little 100th day of school fun, too! And then Monday, February 3rd, will be a 101st day of school blowout! Groundhog Day Activities. Groundhogs are fascinating animals. 
Students in the area have no school on Groundhog Day. Organizers also created a family-only section near the Gobbler's Knob stage.

The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
The First Groundhog’s Day-February 2, 1887. Since 1887, the concept of leaving the yearly weather predictions up to a Groundhog has only grown in popularity. In 1993, there was even a movie out called Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray. That movie only helped to make the holiday more famous. 
As the most famous Groundhog Day celebration in the world, you might be able to assume that the ceremony at Gobbler’s Knob is not the only event Punxsutawney hosts for Groundhog Day. Indeed, there will be numerous events and activities throughout the week leading up to 2025 Groundhog Day, like brewery parties, a talent show, and a bar crawl. 
But there’s no denying that Chuck has a very impressive history when it comes to is accuracy.  the Staten Island Zoo’s resident prognosticator is ready for his annual Groundhog Day ceremony

The comm of “Groundhog day” utilizes an established comm to send its own. 
After a lot of development and collaboration with Harold Ramis, Groundhog Day became the screenplay that ranks #3 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 funniest screenplays ever written. Danny Rubin walked through his journey with the story, screenplay and film of Groundhog Day at the 2014 Austin Film Festival. Thanks to AFF's On Story, you can  
Groundhog Day is a quirky and fun holiday that gets kids excited about the changing seasons and the famous tradition of predicting the weather. Whether the groundhog sees its shadow or not, you can keep the fun going with Groundhog Day coloring pages for kids. 
Groundhog Day casts a long shadow (no pun intended), to the point where the recent Sundance film Before I Fall, which also features time loops, was careful to make it plain they were not inspired by Groundhog Day. But there's no shame in taking inspiration from one of the most interesting and deceptively rich films ever made in Hollywood. 
This day, thanks to the movie starring Bill Murray, has gained more and more popularity as time has gone on. Celebrated every February 2nd, this day is a blend of folklore, tradition, and a touch of whimsy. But there's more to this day than just a groundhog emerging from its burrow.

When the kids have their groundhog masks made, have them put them on and complete an obstacle course while wearing the masks. Say: Today is Groundhog’s Day. That means that very early this morning, a groundhog had to make his way out of his home and into the cold to “predict” how long it will be until winter ends. </p>
