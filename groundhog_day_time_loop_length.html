        <p>Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  
But Groundhog Day’s producers were intentionally cagey about the length of the time loop for a reason: By not putting defined boundaries on Connors’ story of redemption and finding meaning, it  
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
How long was Phil Connors actually stuck in the time loop in "Groundhog Day?" We've broken down all the possible answers.  He is also a long-time volunteer at 826 Valencia, the nationwide after  
Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character, Phil Connors, becomes trapped in a time loop, but the film never explicitly specifies just how many times Phil relives the same day over and over. Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18] Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years.[9] In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years.

Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney  
In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day So it's safe to say the entire timeloop will never be confirmed, but it's somewhere between 10 and 100 years, up to 10,000. 
From IMDB: . On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. 
Two brothers return to a cult that is stuck in a time loop. [54] A Day: 2017: A father attempts to save his daughter whilst stuck in an endless time loop. [55] Reset: 2017: A physicist uses an experimental wormhole machine to travel to parallel universes and back in time by an hour, trying to save her kidnapped son. [56] The Fare: 2018 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
And while time is a kind of container, the ultimate unknown is the measure of what tomorrow holds. “If I am to have a future,” Tara tells us, defiant, “I will have to build it myself.” The post A ‘Groundhog Day’ Time Loop So Long It Spans 7 Enthralling Books appeared first on New York Times. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
He just needs to spend several decades learning everything there is to know abut time. I'd like to tie it into 12:01 but Phil is clearly in the loop for years, whereas 12:01 (the full length movie) has a couple of dozen iterations at most, and the short story has a 1 hour time loop. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years. </p>
