So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for.

So, there you have it. Bill Murray's duration in Groundhog Day's time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Significantly longer than Wolf Gnards' estimation or Ramis' initial prediction, but notably shorter than the 10,000 years originally envisioned in the script. 
Some of the days of Phil's journey are shown in the film, including the Groundhog Day, the day he robs the bank, and the many days it takes for him to take Nancy on the perfect date. There are 38
