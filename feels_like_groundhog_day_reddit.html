        <h2><strong>feels like groundhog day reddit groundhog day i got you babe gif</strong></h2>
        <p>Get up, go to work, go home, dinner, either relax/meal prep/gym/friends, bed, do it again. Weekends I’m tired but do lots of stuff, although a quarter of it is always chores/errands. Then vacation maybe a few weeks a year. Feel like a hamster on a wheel some days. Kinda like that one episode of SpongeBob where Squidward moves to squid town. 
Unfortunately I got sucked in regardless because of boring shit like I need to pay bills. Everyday of my adult life so far feels like Groundhog Day. Wake up, walk dog, go to work, come home, walk dog, dinner, meager time to do projects I want to work on, sleep (late because if I went to bed at a reasonable hour I’d have like two hours to myself). 
Since 2015 or so life has felt like the movie groundhog day where people keep repeating the same actions and talk about the same stuff again and again. People also have repetitive behavior. Some people I work with literally do the same things over and over at the same times. 
I'm 23 I live with my boyfriend(25) and our puppy (10 months). I love them both and I love our house and I'm so lucky to have the life I do. But it feels like every day is groundhog day. We wake up, go to work (from home) then when we finish work we walk the dog and make dinner then clean up 
We can feel like we’re spinning our wheels. We can feel like we’re just going through the motions. We can feel like we are powerless to change our circumstances. We can feel hopeless. I was there recently. The last bit of 2022 was hard for me. I felt like I was stuck in that loop. There were days I didn’t get out of bed. Days that were a  
Well, life sometimes feels stuck just like with the characters in that movie. Learn how to fix that. You might be going through life feeling pretty happy and then all of a sudden, you realize you’ve hit a dead end. Life seems stuckboring, and fairly uneventful. It feels like you are going through the motions just like in that film

Depression makes everyday feel like groundhog day It feels like everyday is the same, the same battle with myself. Everything might be changing around me but for me I cannot tell the difference between yesterday, last week or even last month. 
“When our day is exactly like the last, and we are feeling stress about sickness, economic struggles, and the state of the world and our community, we can fall down a rabbit hole of anxiety and  
Of course, there’s more to it than that but the saying ‘my life feels like groundhog day;’ comes from that film. And if you’ve ever used that phrase yourself, you’ll know exactly what I am talking about. Here are my top 3 tips on how to get yourself out of a rut and get rid of feeling like you’re experiencing Groundhog day. 1. 
107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
Currently it feels like I'm stuck in a groundhog day, where I do one or two things over and over with nearly no progression. I'm in Fall Year 2, this is my 2nd save (lost interest in my first for unrelated reasons) but I feel like I can't do much. 
Feels Like Groundhog Day  Not just for posting my pictures on Reddit - but also for having a dating app at 36.  your responses to your prompts sound more like  
I work from home full time and am in grad school part time. I have a great support system but still feel socially isolated with how limited my socialization is right now. I just feel numb and every day feels the same. I am in therapy and otherwise my life is good, every day just feels the same. 
I can look the other way when tempting images appear, but when night falls, I lose all control. The worst part is that I just don't care at that time. I realize what I should and shouldn't do, but it's like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The longest I've been able to abstain was 6 days. But, tomorrow's another day. Another day full of choices to make. 
Won't answer because they'll just respond with "toughen up, you wimp"(or at least that's what it sounds like.) Finish eating dish. Go back upstairs. Finish homework whilst listening to depressing music. Try to write. Give up. Shower. Sleep and forget everything about the day. That's what my life feels like right now in the weekdays. 
Everyday feels like groundhog day Everyday I wake up, try to move. PAIN, I lay stiff unable to get up and walk to the bathroom, I have to wait for my joints to warm up, takes roughly 30-40 mins. 
My work day seems to take it out of me and the idea of having to do anything else after feels like torture. I see people with ADHD talk about how hard/challenging jobs help them, but I feel like then I’d have the feeling of “ugh, I’m tired and I don’t wanna go to a hard job” everyday. I don’t know how people do this. 
Because so many just feel like Groundhog Day with how repetitive and predictable the story is every episode. Maybe I'm just missing the nuance and not used to this. I'm new to actually watching anime, I've always been interested but didn't know where to start and was worried about being judged. 
Every day feels exactly like the last. I have no motivation, no satisfaction, no pleasure, nothing to look forward to. I’m completely detached from time, from reality, from myself. It could be the same day as 6 months ago and I wouldn’t be able to tell a single difference. My body is numb (no bathroom sen </p>
