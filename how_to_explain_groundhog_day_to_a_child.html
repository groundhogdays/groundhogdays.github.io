        <p>Groundhog Day is on February 2nd. According to legend, if the groundhog comes out of his burrow on February 2nd and does not see its shadow, then Spring will come early.

What Happens on Groundhog Day? On this day, a groundhog comes out of its burrow. If it sees its shadow (which means it's sunny outside), it gets scared and goes back inside.
