The rules are really simple originally, usually with drinking games you keep forgetting when you are supposed to drink but this one is easy. And you get very very drunk. Ive never been so drunk playing a drinking movie game before. Like there are scenes where it shows 5 days over the space of 10 seconds.

It’s full of minor discomforts: Phil (Bill Murray) is away from home at a cheesy B&amp;B, the weather is brutal, his job is banal, and his coworkers are annoying. 
The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with Punxsutawney Phil the grand master of a celebration that draws thousands to the annual morning ritual. And yes people start drinking earlyWhy not? Groundhog Day – The Movie &amp; Drinking Games. Watching the movie Groundhog Day is a crucial part of celebrating

Groundhog Day is my favorite movie. I'm 25 years old so it's barely in my demographic to like, if it all. If you haven't seen that movie it honestly is the perfect movie.
