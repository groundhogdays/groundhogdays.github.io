        <p>When Phil wakes again at 6AM on Groundhog Day, he starts the day with a positive attitude and begins to use the repeating days to do good and learn new skills. Climax: Phil spends the day helping people based on the knowledge of events he has gained, and makes ice sculptures. He plays piano with a local band at a dance. 
This is also the case in Groundhog Day. We meet our main character Phil who is a narcissistic and self-centred weatherman and who very much hates having to go to Punxsutawney to report about Groundhog Day.

Form: Groundhog Day follows a clear narrative line, with plot development, a climax, resolution and all that good stuff. However, what sets it apart from other films (and what makes it so damned special) is its quirky central premise – that the same day is being repeated over, and over, and over (and over) again. 
Groundhog Day takes this and many other romantic comedy clichés and mocks them at the same time as it gets all the mileage it can out of theromance of the situations — which is a big reason the story appealed equally to male and female audiences.
