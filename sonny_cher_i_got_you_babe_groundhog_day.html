I Got You Babe - Sonny &amp; Cher("Groundhog Day" - "Ricomincio Da Capo", 1993)YOU CAN BUY THE SOUNDTRACK HERE:  CAN BUY THE MOVIE HERE 
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
Every alarm clock sequence in Groundhog Day. 
The movie grew a cult of fans that watched it every February 2, giving it a foothold in the popular culture. By association, "I Got You Babe" became part of the groundhog day tradition. In 2020, Bill Murray appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for the Jeep Gladiator where the song plays throughout. In the spot, he re-creates the film, but this  
“I Got You, Babe” will never be the same again.  The brilliance of Groundhog Day is that it manages to put you right in the  right after the closing strains of Sonny and Cher’s  
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there.

Happy Groundhog Day! 
In the waning hours of Groundhog Day, I'm reflecting on the movie which bears its name. I didn't get the chance yet to watch it like I normally do this time of year; that must wait for the weekend. However, I can certainly still talk about it through the song that defines it: Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe." 
Sonny &amp; Cher began their career as backing singers for Phil Spector. By the mid-sixties they were married and pop stars as their first hit single, “I Got You Babe” topped the American singles chart for three weeks during 1965. “I Got You Babe” is a product of its era. 
Groundhog Day is anchored by uplifting songs that make a complex foundation for a quirky film. Sonny &amp; Cher’s epochal “I Got You Babe” heralds the dawn in the protagonist's eternal holiday, while “Phil’s Piano Solo” represents his fitful transformation from miserly weatherman to lovable humanist. 
[Verse 1: Bono &amp; Cher] They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow Well I don't know if all that's true 'Cause you got me, and baby, I got you [Chorus: Bono &amp; Both] Babe
