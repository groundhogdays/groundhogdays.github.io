        <p>Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

The actual Punxsutawney Phil made an appearance in the film: The real groundhog who portrays Punxsutawney Phil, the famous weather-predicting rodent, appeared in the movie alongside Bill Murray. This added an authentic touch to the story. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Numerous outlets have since cited the WhatCulture piece as, essentially, the definitive answer — it does, after all, align with Ramis’ own prediction. So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
The film "Groundhog Day," directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray, offers viewers a unique and philosophical exploration of the human condition through the character of Phil Connors. Trapped in a time loop, Phil is forced to relive the same day repeatedly, providing an opportunity for profound self-discovery and moral transformation. 
Although the trope of endlessly repeating the same day has appeared in nearly every medium across the world, the most well-known example is undoubtedly Harold Ramis's 1993 romantic comedy film Groundhog Day. In the film, narcissistic weather reporter Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, is stuck in a time loop, reliving Groundhog Day in  
What's not to love about Bill Murray as an ill-fated weatherman who is forced to relive the same day over and over in Groundhog Day? Comedy gold. If you've ever wondered the real reasons why Murray's sourpuss meteorologist was chosen to repeat the same sadistic time loop, voiceover artist Eddie Deezen has your answer. He ponders why Murray's  
Throughout the whole movie we see Phil as cold and gradually warming as he relives the day over and over again until he finally falls in love and realizes what love is all about. But what happens on that February 3rd? Phil has spent decades trapped in a single day living the intricacies over and over again. 
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow.

The premise of the film is that Phil Connors (Murray), a prima donna local weatherman, is sent to cover Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where he enters a strange time loop  
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
Why does Phil Connors repeat Groundhog Day? Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated.
