"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere.

Bob Dylan's use of the word "Babe" in his 1964 song "It Ain't Me Babe" gave Sonny Bono the idea to use it in this song. In the 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray, Murray's character is awakened to this song every morning at precisely 6:00 a.m. on the alarm clock in his hotel room.

When an older and more haggard Phil from the film &amp;quot;Groundhog Day&amp;quot; once again wakes to the accursed Sonny and Cher song that has haunted him for too many mornings, he fears the worst -- that he&amp;#039;s been returned to his infinite, groundhog-centric time loop from over two decades ago. Upon stepping outside, he quickly outpaces the infamous Ned before catching sight of a 2020 Jeep
