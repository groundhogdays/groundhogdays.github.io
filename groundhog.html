        <h2><strong>groundhog how often do they replace the groundhog for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>The groundhog (Marmota monax), also known as the woodchuck, is a rodent of the family Sciuridae, belonging to the group of large ground squirrels known as marmots. [2] A lowland creature of North America, it is found through much of the Eastern United States , across Canada and into Alaska . [ 3 ] 
Groundhog, (Marmota monax), one of 14 species of marmots (Marmota), considered basically a giant North American ground squirrel. It is sometimes destructive to gardens and pasturelands. Classified as a marmot, the groundhog is a member of the squirrel family, Sciuridae, within the order Rodentia. 
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
Groundhog Day is a tradition that has taken place annually in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since Feb. 2, 1987. A groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, is brought out at sunrise to make a prediction on how the remaining winter will play out. 
*Note that some groundhogs did not make predictions every year in the past 20 years. Special Mention: Punxsatawney Phil. Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil.

Groundhog hibernation gave rise to the popular U.S. custom of Groundhog Day, held on February 2 every year. Tradition dictates that if a groundhog comes out of its burrow and sees its shadow  
The average groundhog weighs as much as 11lbs. Despite their stocky build, they are surprisingly quick. Groundhogs are also good swimmers and tree climbers. They have two layers of fur: a dense grey undercoat and a longer coat of banded guard hairs that gives the groundhog a “frosted” appearance. 
A groundhog den will have at least two entrances so that the residents have a way to escape from predators. Many ground squirrels and marmots construct elaborate dens to house large social groups – prairie dogs, for example, build huge burrows known as “towns.” But the groundhog is unusual in that it appears to be solitary. 
The groundhog is a terrestrial mammal that prefers to seek cover in its underground burrow. However it is a good swimmer and can also climb trees to escape danger. The groundhog is often referred to as a woodchuck, a name derived from the Indian word "wuchak." Its most common claim to fame is "groundhog day." 
Known for Groundhog Day and weather prediction, nearsighted groundhogs (aka woodchucks) have an important place in the ecosystem. They provide food for coyotes, foxes, weasels, badgers, hawks and eagles, and their burrows give shelter to amphibians, reptiles, rodents and foxes. 
The groundhog, or woodchuck, is one of 14 species of marmots, a subgroup of the squirrel family.One of the largest members, groundhogs live a feast-or-famine lifestyle: they gorge themselves all
