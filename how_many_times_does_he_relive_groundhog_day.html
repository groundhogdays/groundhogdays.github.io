        <h2><strong>how many times does he relive groundhog day groundhog day hidden picture</strong></h2>
        <p>The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
Numerous outlets have since cited the WhatCulture piece as, essentially, the definitive answer — it does, after all, align with Ramis’ own prediction. So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis  
That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? Well, there are 38 days actually shown on screen, as well as 414 days mentioned in the film and a huge 11,931 days which Phil spends learning a host of new talents and interests - based on the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert  
How many times did Bill Murray relive Groundhog Day?  We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the  
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
Widely considered to be one of the best comedy movies of all time, "Groundhog Day's" story of weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) struggling to break free from living the same 24-hour period  
Which, in turn, means it's time to ask the question that has sat in the minds of viewers since 1993: How many times does weatherman Phil Connors repeat the same day in his purgatorial Punxsutawney? The question is repeatedly asked, but is not — cannot — be categorically answered. Screenwriter Danny Rubin has one vague answer. 
2 February is Groundhog Day – when, according to Punxsutawney folklore – a groundhog called Punxsutawney Phil predicts the arrival of spring.  Bill Murray's character relives the same day  
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
WhatCulture.com worked out just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film’s 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the torturous time equates to repeating the same day 12,395 times. 
Well a film blog has worked it out for you: 33 years and 350 days. WhatCulture.com worked out just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film’s 20th anniversary. 
He tried saving the old man countless times. He drank at the bar with his co worker many times He saw the movie Rio Bravo for the 100th time by the time we saw him with that chick. He saved the kid from falling he would've figured that out after a long time. 
Just how many days does Phil Connors spend trapped in the perpetual loop of Groundhog Day?  and alloting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later  
It is not directly stated in the movie and there are plenty of days that happened off-screen, making counting by viewers impossible. However this same question was asked over on the Movies &amp; TV Stack Exchange site and it was stated that there were 160 days in the book that the movie is based on. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer.
