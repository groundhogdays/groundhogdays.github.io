        <p>Matthew Warchus: “Groundhog Day is one of my all-time favourite films and making the musical stage adaptation with Danny Rubin and Tim Minchin was one of the happiest creative experiences of my life. With echoes of classics such as The Music Man and It’s A Wonderful Life, the Groundhog Day film manages to be both a great screwball comedy  
Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book  Tim Minchin Nominated Chita Rivera  This page was last edited on 29 January 2025,  
Newsday called it “an ingenious, witty, joyously offbeat musical.” NY1 said “Danny Rubin’s wryly humorous book and Tim Minchin’s clever songs, the forecast for this Groundhog Day looks pretty bright!” Groundhog Day was a New York Times Critics Pick and the Washington Post said “The surprises are consistently amazing!” 
Groundhog Day. July 31 through August 31, 2025. Book by Danny Rubin Music &amp; Lyrics by Tim Minchin. Directed by Jerry Vess Choreographer: Kristin Rigsby Music Director: Trey Pope Production Manager: Kylie Sjolie Stage Manager: Kylie Sjolie. How would you spend your time if forced to repeat the same day over and over again? 
OPENS January 31, 2025 - A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.  Set to a hilarious and heartfelt score by Tim Minchin, Groundhog Day  
Tim Minchin is a comedian, actor, composer, songwriter, pianist and director.  11th-15th February 2025. Foundry Theatre, Sydney  Matilda and Groundhog Day,  
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man’s journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical). 
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
To many, Punxsutawney Phil is the official groundhog for Groundhog Day. And crowds of revelers will be waiting for his prediction. Skip to Article.  (updated 1/1/2025).  
Amazing. You’ve summed up the deep, essential point of Groundhog Day — and most of the world’s mystic wisdom — in one gorgeous song. (Reminiscent but not redundant of Not Perfect.) Like Sondheim you don’t get simple and emotional often, but when you do it’s awesome. Relieved that Groundhog Day is in the best possible hands  
The award-winning and record-breaking Groundhog Day The Musical will have its Australian premiere in Melbourne early next year.. Direct from its record-breaking return season at London’s Old Vic, Groundhog Day The Musical will play exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre, for a strictly limited season from January 24th, 2024. 
William Cramer on 22nd of February 2020. Awesome. So glad you did this. When I was young, I wanted to learn and actually did play the piano because of this movie. Instead of doing nothing everyday in my life, watching VHS tapes and playing Nintendo back then, I thought Bill Murray was right. 
Thanks, Tim. I saw Groundhog Day on Broadway (twice) and now I’m listening to the soundtrack yet again, but with new ears. I also saw Matilda on Broadway and just yesterday caught an excellent local production by Theatre Lawrence (Kansas). Now I’ll lobby for them do Groundhog Day. I’m ordering the songbook from my local bookshop, The Raven. 
Tim Minchin is a comedian, actor, composer, songwriter, pianist and director.  11th-15th February 2025. Foundry Theatre, Sydney  Matilda and Groundhog Day,  
Tim’s gonna be on your telly-boxes, Australians! This coming Sunday, 8th December, Tim’ll be seated behind the desk on The Project on Channel 10.. The show airs at 6:30pm, and he’ll be joining hosts and regular panellists Tommy Little, Hamish MacDonald, Lisa Wilkinson and Susie Youssef as they dissect and give their unique take on the day’s news. 
Tim will perform songs drawn from his 2020 studio album, Apart Together, from his musicals, Matilda and Groundhog Day, from his TV and film writing, and perhaps even some from his early songwriting days in the late 20th century. 
Tim Minchin is a comedian, actor, composer, songwriter, pianist and director.  11th-15th February 2025. Foundry Theatre, Sydney  Matilda and Groundhog Day,  
The setlist will be fluid and the shows will have more of an unplanned intimate ‘evening with’ vibe as Tim chats about his songwriting and performs songs drawn from his 2020 studio album, Apart Together, his musicals, Matilda and Groundhog Day, his TV and film writing and from his early song-writing days around the turn of the century. 
The other day I posted the "I know everything" song from Groundhog Day. Here's the "I know Nothing" song. (It's actually called Seeing You). There are still  </p>
