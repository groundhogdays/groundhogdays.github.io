        <p>The Old Vic has dropped a brand new trailer for its hit show Groundhog Day The Musical. Groundhog Day is running at The Old Vic until 19 August 2023 – only 4 weeks to go. But rumours are also swirling Theatreland that the show may get a new life in the West End, with unconfirmed reports that The Old Vic is looking for a West End home for the  
Groundhog Day The Musical most recently played at The Old Vic theatre from 20 May to 19 August 2023. There’s no current news on a West End transfer for Groundhog Day The Musical but check back for news, or sign-up for email alerts. 
The Old Vic’s revival of its award-winning musical Groundhog Day is extending its run at the theatre by one week. The show will now play at The Old Vic until 19 August 2023. Also, new production photos are in for show, which stars Andy Karl , reprising his Olivier Award-winning performance as Phil Connors, alongside Tanisha Spring as Rita Hanson. 
Groundhog Day returned to The Old Vic on 20 May 2023 for previews, with an opening night on 8 June 2023, running until 19 August 2023. The original team of Matthew Warchus, Tim Minchin, Danny Rubin and Chris Nightingale reworked the show with a view to a tour and/or West End transfer. Changes included simpler staging (removing the revolves), tightening up the songs and script, and losing a  
Groundhog Day reunites most of the creative team behind Matilda the Musical, including music and lyrics by Australian comedian Tim Minchin. The score is quite possibly one of the greatest in West End history, with euphoric tunes and witty lyrics galore. Minchin is joined by award-winning director Matthew Warchus, whose creativity is spellbinding. 
Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin. It is based on the 1993 film of the same name , directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Rubin. 
The London production of Groundhog Day the Musical has now officially announced its eagerly anticipated Broadway transfer. The New York production will open at the August Wilson Theatre, following the departure of Jersey Boys after an 11 year run, with an official press night set for 17 April 2017. 
Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when the cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the eccentric annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, he finds himself caught in a time loop that sends him on a hilarious path to enlightenment and redemption. A comic parable of love, hope and transformation from the creatives behind Matilda The Musical and

Warchus also said that “it has been a true honour and delight to bring Groundhog Day back to The Old Vic and give it a fresh new lease of life. The show, now seen by over 65,000 people in 2016 and almost 90,000 people this summer, has broken all box office records (including its own records set in 2016) and its immense popularity is a tribute not only to the brilliant writers, Tim Minchin  
Groundhog Day The Musical returned to London last year for a short stint at the Old Vic Theatre. The hit musical comedy from director Matthew Warchus and lyricist Tim Minchin enjoyed fabulous reviews from the London critics and sold exceptionally well. The West End could do with more musical comedy’s so it’s time to give this show a full  
Groundhog Day had its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in 2016, winning two Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl, plus the Critics’ Circle Award for Best Musical and four BroadwayWorld UK/West End Awards including Theatrical Event of the Year. 
Earlier this week Groundhog Day celebrated its official opening at the Old Vic. It had previously been announced that the musical would open on Broadway on 9th March 2017 (previews from 23rd January). However, following reports in the New York Times that producer Scott Rudin has departed the project, the musical's Broadway run has been pushed back. New dates and a theatre are yet to be announced. 
Possibly 2015, expect a West End transfer. LINKS. Tickets and info on Groundhog Day The Musical. Kinky Boots The Musical – West End. Billy Porter in Kinky Boots on

Technically not a Broadway transfer as it had a limited run at the Old Vic in 2016, but following its short Broadway run it’s time to bring this hit musical comedy from Matthew Warchus and Tim Minchin, the creative team behind Matilda The Musical, back for a full West End season. 
Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London. With music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus, Groundhog Day has a book by Danny Ruben, who co-wrote the screenplay of the original movie, which starred Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. 
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
Andy Karl recently starred as Phil Connors in Groundhog Day The Musical at the Old Vic Theatre in London.. Andy’s theatre work includes Groundhog Day at the Old Vic and on Broadway, for which he won an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical, and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical.

Full casting has been announced for the world premiere of the upcoming production of Groundhog Day the Old Vic Theatre. The new musical will star Carlyss Peer as Rita Hanson alongside the previously announced Andy Karl in the role of Phil Connors. </p>
