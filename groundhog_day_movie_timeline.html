The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
In case you weren’t already feeling old, February 2 is the 30th anniversary of the release of Groundhog Day, the story of our favorite narcissistic, self-centered weatherman, who finds himself stuck in a time loop on Groundhog Day. This is particularly meaningful to me because I worked on this classic film and it just keeps reappearing every  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. It stars Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2nd repeatedly. It was  
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject

1993: Release of "Groundhog Day" Movie The release of the comedy film "Groundhog Day" in 1993 boosted the holiday's popularity, particularly on an international level. 1995: Early Spring Prediction 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day.
