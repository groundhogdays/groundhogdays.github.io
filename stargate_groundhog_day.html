        <p>Mallozzi and Mullie later became executive producers of both Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. The episode's unusual story style caused an unexpected shortage of footage during filming, which director Peter DeLuise compensated for by shooting additional scenes, many of which were humorous. "Window of Opportunity" is widely regarded as a fan  
Window of Opportunity: Directed by Peter DeLuise. With Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c realize they and their friends are trapped in a time loop. 
"Window of Opportunity" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of Stargate SG-1. On a routine mission to P4X-639, SG-1 meets an alien archaeologist Malakai operating an Ancient device. Malakai has his own motives and causes a time loop, where only Colonel Jack O'Neill and Teal'c notice. Furthermore, convincing the rest they are trapped in a time loop and that they have to return to the  
And, like the Groundhog Day aspects of this episode, it almost didn't happen. The episode was timing short, it was clear we would need to come up with some extra scenes, and that gave Brad the opportunity to do something he had always wanted to do: see our characters golfing through the Stargate. 
Groundhog Day was a popular movie on Earth involving a time loop. While trapped in a time loop by Malakai, Colonel Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was attempting to become the king of Groundhog Day. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity")

Memory Wipe Exploitation: Jack and Teal'c are caught in a "Groundhog Day" Loop and eventually decide to take advantage of the lack of consequences. Ranging from using the stargate as a driving range to Jack not-quite violating the fraternization rules with Carter (he hands in his resignation first and then immediately goes to find Carter and  
Stargate SG-1's version of Groundhog Day was thoroughly entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud frequently. Yet this episode was not the comic book that "Upgrades" was. A recurring loop of time is at least more plausible than the superhuman powers experienced by the team in "Upgrades." 
Groundhog Day is a Tau'ri movie about time looping. History. Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was trying to be king of Groundhog Day after activating the Time loop machine. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity") O'Neill asked the ascended Daniel Jackson if he would stop by for Groundhog Day to

I've only recently discovered the StarGate SG-1 series and have been working through it. The line "Where have you been all my life" comes to mind. Anyway, this is by far my favorite episode of all. Groundhog day has always been a favorite of mine but this takes it to a new level.

It's not as good as a standalone episode. But when you start at episode 1 and watch right up to this one, it's a lot of fun. Besides, It's Groundhog Day in the stargate universe. Who doesn't love Groundhog Day and Stargate? 
Stargate SG1’s was fantastic, with Col. O’Neill (“with two L’s”) and Teal’c trapped in the time loop.  It was a "hey let's do groundhog day" with no  
Considering Doctor Who is a show that is heavily reliant on the concept of time travel, it should come as no surprise that it has a Groundhog Day episode of its own. In “Heaven Sent,” the Doctor finds himself trapped in a remote castle on Gallifrey, where he’s relentlessly pursued by a terrifying creature known as the Veil, only to be reborn in a glass chamber every time he’s killed. 
"Groundhog Day" Loop: The whole point of the episode. O'Neill even mentions the Trope Namer when they confront Malikai. Hidden Depths: O'Neill eventually takes advantage of the loops to learn pottery.

In the "Window of Opportunity" episode, at one of the iterations, O'Neill resigns from the military, and when asked "why" he gleefuly exclaims "So I can do this", grabs Samantha Carter in a "V-J Day in Times Square" display and kisses her. As far as the rules for the groundhog day went, only O'Neill and Teal'c remembered the previous iterations. </p>
