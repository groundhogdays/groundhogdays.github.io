The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example.
