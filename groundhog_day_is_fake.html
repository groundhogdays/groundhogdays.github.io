        <p>Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the U.S. since 1887. Thousands of observers flock to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year on Feb. 2 to see Phil predict the weather. 
PETA activists are calling for Punxsutawney Phil, the region’s fluffiest weather predictor, to be replaced with a vegan “weather reveal cake” during Sunday’s annual Groundhog Day  
Life &amp; Culture; Is Punxsutawney Phil a fraud? Here’s how he ranks against his Groundhog Day competitors. Published: Jan. 30, 2025, 1:37 p.m. 
What is Groundhog Day and when is it? Groundhog Day is celebrated on Monday, Feb. 2 this year. People far and wide travel to Gobbler’s Knob to witness Phil's prediction. 
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club has not released any response to PETA but has recently announced Punxsutawney Phil as Ace Hardware's newest "seasonal employee" and details on Groundhog Day at  
The group wants to replace Phil with a fake groundhog, powered by artificial intelligence -- or even an enormous gold coin-- which PETA says would be far more accurate as our planet warms. 
PETA has suggested that Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who predicts whether winter will go on for six more weeks or spring will arrive early, should be replaced with a vegan 'weather reveal

In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time Groundhog Day appeared in the newspaper, according to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler's Knob. 
If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club doesn’t like the cake idea, Newkirk offered to provide them with a large thermometer that reads, “If it’s still cold, it’s still winter.” PETA has previously called for Phil’s retirement and offered multiple alternatives for Groundhog’s Day, including a giant gold coin last year. 
These historical celebrations have made Groundhog Day what it is today. The first “modern” day Groundhog Day was February 2, 1887. It took place in the small little town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. It began as a prank by the newspaper and s ince that day there is a celebration that thousands of people attend every year in 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a

No, Groundhog Day 2 won’t happen for a very straightforward reason: the story has already been told. The original film was regarded as an entirely self-contained, stand-alone narrative. The original film was regarded as an entirely self-contained, stand-alone narrative. 
Hollywood, CA - Sony Entertainment has announced that it will soon release a sequel to the 1993 hit Groundhog Day that is exactly the same as the last one. For those unfamiliar with the original film, Groundhog Day follows self-centered weatherman Phil Connors who finds himself reliving the same day over and over during an assignment in Punxsutawney, PA. Only a drastic self-transformation will  
Some other cities, such as Washington, DC, celebrate Groundhog Day with a fake stuffed groundhog named Potomac Phil. Others may not celebrate the holiday or watch for the results of Punxsutawney Phil’s emergence from his den online. Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, has its own celebration with a groundhog named Jimmy. 
On the first day Phil wakes in the hotel, he looks out of the window and sees certain cars moving and turning. The next day (at around 19 mins) he looks out of the window again and sees exactly the same cars etc. as though it is exactly the same time, but the time is different based on the radio show that is at a different point.
