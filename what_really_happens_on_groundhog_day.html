Groundhog Day should be on everyone’s bucket list. Groundhog Day is held at Gobbler’s Knob, a field a little under two miles outside of downtown Punxsutawney, PA. The gates to the grounds open at 3am. No tickets are required as Groundhog Day is a free event. From 3am until approximately 7:20am, a party happens at Gobbler’s Knob. 
Groundhog Day takes place every year in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where the resident groundhog makes his prediction on the remaining winter.

It offers a moment of levity in the depths of winter and connects people to nature and the changing seasons. Bill Murray Groundhog Day.
