        <p>Rising TikTok star dead at 17, cause of death revealed  Kentucky groundhog dies on Groundhog Day after making prediction of an early spring By . Katherine Donlevy. Published Feb. 3, 2024, 9:43  
The Second Chances Wildlife Center shared on social media that their beloved weather-predicting groundhog, Major, died on Groundhog Day. "Sadly, and most ironically, Major passed away peacefully  
Major the groundhog lived at Second Chances Wildlife Center in Bullitt County after he was rescued as a baby. Sadly, the center reports Major died overnight at 10 years old. 
It was a somber Groundhog Day in Canada, as Fred la marmotte – the beloved groundhog who predicted weather – was found dead hours before he could take part in his annual tradition. 
The organizer of Thursday's Groundhog Day event in Val-d'Espoir announced the sombre news following some 40 minutes of festivities, including music and dancing. 
Milltown Mel, a groundhog who has for years offered his weather predictions on Groundhog Day, has died, his handlers say. They say Mel "recently crossed over the rainbow bridge" — and their  
Mel died just before Groundhog Day, leaving his community in central New Jersey "at a tough time of year, when most of his fellow groundhogs are hibernating." In a Facebook post, the wranglers  
Blondin discovered his furry friend had died when he went to wake him from hibernation to get him ready for the Groundhog Day ritual. For the past 14 years, Fred would wake up every Feb. 2 to let  
Instead of announcing a weather prediction, organizers of a Canadian Groundhod Day event shocked the crowd by announcing their beloved groundhog, Fred la Marmotte, was dead. 
The tradition of Groundhog Day says that if a prognosticator groundhog sees its shadow on the morning of the holiday, there will be six more weeks of winter, but if the animal doesn't, then spring  
But back in 2021, that Jersey groundhog - Milltown Mel, um, well, died. It is now 2025 and ol' Mel is still dead. The problem is - there was no backup for Mel. No reserve groundhog, no backup groundhog. No groundhog waiting-in-the-wings, no understudy groundhog. The people in Milltown had all their faith in Mel - but, he died. 
This year's Groundhog Day festivity in Milltown, New Jersey, is canceled, according to the Facebook post. "We Wranglers are sad to report that Milltown Mel recently crossed over the rainbow bridge  
The 6’5” mayor was visiting the zoo for Groundhog Day on Feb. 2, 2014, when he ran into trouble wrangling the anxious rodent.  Chuck was found dead in his enclosure just days later on Feb  
Groundhog Day is an "unusual holiday," according to the Farmers Almanac, that dates back centuries to European traditions. It was originally a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross

Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
Its Groundhog Day was “magical,” said Korman, who started hosting Groundhog Day Eve parties with 20 friends packed into his small apartment.  But more focus on Milltown’s dead groundhog  
Fans of Groundhog Day will be happy to know that its shining star, Punxsutawney Phil, has not died in 2022. Indeed, the famous animal emerged from his burrow on Feb. 2, 2022, and saw his shadow, predicting another extra six weeks of winter. 
A weather-predicting groundhog, Milltown Mel, has died just days before he was meant to particpate in Groundhog Day. On 2 February, Milltown Mel, from New Jersey, was set to participate in the big  
If it seems like you're heard this story of a New Jersey groundhog dying before, that's not just a Groundhog Day effect: in 2016, Sussex County's prognosticator, Stonewall Jackson, died on Groundhog Eve, according to NJ.com.
