        <p>And I’ve loved this trope since I first watched the film Groundhog Day. When I read In a Holidaze last year, it reminded me of how much I enjoy reading books with the trope, as well. If you haven’t watched the film Palm Springs , it has an updated approach to the trope that I also enjoyed. 
Books shelved as trope-groundhog-day: In a Holidaze by Christina Lauren, Time and Time Again by Chatham Greenfield, The Do-Over by Lynn Painter, Midnight 
The 1993 classic film ‘Groundhog Day’ popularized the trope of time loops in modern media. Here are 4 books that feature time loops of adventure! Abigail Monti – February 10th, 2023 
Yeah, I don’t know either. Considering this concept has become a popular trope in books and films — I think about it frequently. My first introduction to the time loop trope was “11 Birthdays,” a children’s book by Wendy Mass that follows a girl who relives the day of her 11th birthday alongside her estranged best friend. 
2. "4 3 2 1" by Paul Auster. 4 3 2 1 tells the stories of young Archie Ferguson growing up in the 1950s and ’60s. Notice the plural stories: the entire book hinges on a ‘what if’ moment, where the plot splits into four possible lives Archie might go on to live. 
Just in time for Groundhog’s Day (the holiday), we have a list of great time loop novels like Groundhog’s Day (the movie)! Just kidding! If you’re familiar with the 1993 film, you know that reporter Bill Murray gets stuck in a small town covering the news about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who may or may not see his shadow. 
I've watched several Christmas movies that features a time loop plot. I think there's been a few sitcoms that played with the plot trope. This week's Quantum Leap (the remake) episode had its own take on Groundhog Day. Recently I read a book that I thought had an interesting take on the trope and I wondered what other books have used it. 
A murder mystery novel inspired by Agatha Christie with a dash of Groundhog Day and a hint of Quantum Leap and Downton Abbey.If that doesn’t make you want to read The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton, then maybe this will. 
Popularized by the 1993 film Groundhog Day, the time loop trope has been featured in many pieces of media over the last few decades. In honor of this year’s Groundhog Day, let’s take a look at this popular phenomenon. What is this trope, why does it work so well, and what are some books that feature this trope?

The Swedish title translates as "Monday the entire week". The movie, however, does not specify what day of the week it is supposed to be, and Groundhog Day (February 2) in 1993 was a Tuesday. The German title of the movie is Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier, which can be translated as "The groundhog greets every day". The title has been

It has also inspired a generation of philosophers and theologians. One book focused on philosophy and religion in pop culture with a bevy of contributors saw everyone fighting to claim this movie as representing their philosophy/religion. Pop Culture Holiday: TV stations typically celebrate the film on February 2nd along with the real Groundhog

"When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But standing here among the people of Punxsutawney and basking in the warmth of their hearths  
The "Groundhog Day trope" is when a character finds themselves stuck in a time loop where they repeat the same day over and over. For a list of books on BTW with this trope, click here. Notable Examples. No notable examples have been added yet. To add some, click on "Edit". 
For a little bit of Black Comedy, the montage of Rita slapping Phil day after day (sort of), even though it leads directly to his Despair Event Horizon. When Rita first reveals she majored in Nineteenth Century French Poetry, Phil can't help guffawing and exclaim, "What a complete waste of time!" 
A plot in which the character is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of time (often exactly one day) over and over, until something is corrected. Usually, only one character or group of characters realizes what's going on—everyone and everything else undergoes a complete Snap Back, and if not interfered with will do the exact same things every time, right down to dialogue. 
Phil's Driven to Suicide montage, while a brilliant bit of Black Comedy, is also pretty tragic when you think about it. Phil then wakes up to find himself still trapped in the loop. His subdued "Aw, nuts" when he wakes up just drives it home. He  
The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is one of a select group of works featuring a "Groundhog Day" Loop to reference the Trope Namer. At the end of Happy Death Day , Carter, who's been helping Tree (the one going through the time loops), is told the story she's been going through and mentions the film , which she claims she's never heard of. </p>
