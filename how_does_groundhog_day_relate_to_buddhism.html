        <p>The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. 
WOODSTOCK, Ill. (RNS) — Woodstock Willie, perhaps the second most famous groundhog in the country, saw his shadow Thursday (Feb. 2), predicting another six weeks of winter. 
In Groundhog Day, the sarcastic Phil Connors repeatedly wakes the same day. Phil, a groundhog, and the weatherman’s namesake sees the man’s shadow, and scurries back into his burrow, implying  
For a lot of people, Groundhog Day is simply a timeless time loop comedy that holds up just as well now as it did more than 30 years ago. On the other side of the coin, there are practitioners and devotees to the Buddhist lifestyle that maintain it speaks to them on a much deeper level than simply being a wildly entertaining ride, which isn’t  
‘Groundhog Day’ is all about you, today You don’t have to subscribe to Buddhism or Christianity or believe in reincarnation or heaven for this story to be directly applicable to your daily life. 
Despite almost no mention of God or religion, the filmmakers of "Groundhog Day" made one of the more spiritual films of the era. “You can argue about whether it is a Buddhist, Christian or Jewish movie — but it is deeply religious,” said author and Boston University religion professor Stephen Prothero, who has shown the film in his classes. 
Groundhog Day wonderfully exemplifies the power of approaching each moment as though it were a completely new experience. This is perfectly conveyed in Buddhist practice. When the bell rings in a  
Woodstock Willie, perhaps the second most famous groundhog in the country, saw his shadow Thursday (Feb. 2), predicting another six weeks of winter. The early morning prediction, viewed by a crowd who braved below-freezing temperatures, was part of a five-day celebration of the release of “Groundhog Day,” a now classic film starring Bill Murray released in 1993 and filmed in this small  
Buddhist monasticism is itself “Groundhog”-like with the same routine, clothes and daily rituals — for decades of practice.  And who doesn’t relate, at one time or another, for one day  
A few years later, in 2001, Groundhog Day was screened as part of a Buddhist film series organized by Michael Wenger, a Sōtō Zen priest who was then the dean of Buddhist studies at the San Francisco Zen Center. In a subsequent lecture, Wenger argued that Groundhog Day not only illustrates the law of karma, but also “parallels Buddhist  
The film Groundhog Day demonstrates the wonder of living each moment as a totally new event. It follows a day in the life of weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic curmudgeon. He wakes upon the same day, Groundhog Day, again, and again, and again. 
For some reason Groundhog Day was the only video we had at the time (we're talking good old VCR days). I literally watched that movie over and over and over again. Now whenever I think of that movie I think about being really fucking itchy. This has nothing to do with Buddhism but I just thought I'd share.. 
Buddhism and Groundhogs Day Buddhism is an ancient philosophy which originated in Eastern Asia and was founded about 2,500 years ago. Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, has a unique understanding of existence in the world. Buddha's belief of existence contradicts the life Phil, the main character in the movie Groundhog's Day, lives. 
How does the movie groundhog day relate to buddhism gods. How does the motion picture groundhog calendar day attach headed for buddhism gods. before: Dairyu Michael Wenger Sensei: The authentic crossing of detection consists not appear in bearing in mind another landscapes although appear in having another eyes. 
Every day seems like the first lesson, but, in fact, day-by-day Phil is progressing into a competent musician. He also takes up ice sculpture, an art form perfectly suited to small-town Pennsylvania in February. 
Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
Whether Buddhist or not, the final message of Groundhog Day is clear: if you’re feeling trapped in a cycle of meaninglessness, the solution is to embrace love and friendship, and maybe learn a new skill or two. The Gautama knew it some 2,500 years ago, and the Bill Murray recommends it now. 
Getty Images. Shortly after the film’s release, members of the military began using the term “Groundhog Day” as slang, in reference to the monotony of their days.In 1994, the crew of the USS  
Ummon didn't mean that every day was good in a Pollyanna-ish way, but that every day, even the most tragic, has within it the seeds of renewal, of Spring. Depending on how Phil the groundhog sees his shadow, winter could go on, or not. Depending on how Phil Connors responds to each new day, he could grow and change, or not. </p>
