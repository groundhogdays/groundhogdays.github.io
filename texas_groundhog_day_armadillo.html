        <h2><strong>texas groundhog day armadillo when is groundhog day on tv uk</strong></h2>
        <p>BEE CAVE, Texas — It's no secret that the state of Texas likes to do things its own way, and Groundhog Day is no different. While the rest of the U.S. trusts Punxsutawney Phil's prediction, Texans prefer an armadillo's expertise. Bee Cave Bob the armadillo is the state's resident weather enthusiast and mascot for Armadillo Day. 
It's Groundhog Day Texas-style on February 2 as Bee Cave Bob the armadillo will predict either an early spring or prolonged winter for the 15th year.  Texas, Friday, Feb 2, 2022. Armadillo Day  
In the neverending quest to put the Lone Star State's signature on just about everything, Texas has been looking to its own weather-predicting animal on Feb 2. What is usually considered Punxsutawney Phil's big day (the groundhog), is now a day for one of the Lone Star State's most iconic animals; an armadillo. 
Bee Cave Bob, an eight-year-old armadillo, predicts the weather and political climate on Feb. 2, the same day as Groundhog Day. See photos of Bob and other armadillos at Armadillo Day, a festival in Bee Cave, Texas. 
For much of the country, it’s known as Groundhog Day, built around the personage of Punxsutawney Phil. In Texas, however, it’s Armadillo Day, which rests on the prophetic powers of Bee Cave Bob. Bee Cave Bob’s career began in 2012, when a group of buddies in Central Texas—formally known as the Benevolent Knights of the Raccoon—decided  
For much of the country, Feb. 2 is known as Groundhog Day. Punxsutawney Phil has been prognosticating spring’s return on that day for more than 135 years. In Texas, however, the day is known as Armadillo Day, and the predictions come from Bee Cave Bob. The nine-banded armadillo has been on the job since 2010. 
Since 2010, Burke and his friends have been using the armored critter for their own weather-forecasting ceremonies in Bee Cave on Feb. 2, a date traditionally known as Groundhog Day, marked

Bee Cave Bob, an armadillo from Texas, did not see his shadow on Feb. 2, 2024, and predicted an early spring start date of March 11. This is Texas' version of Groundhog Day, created by a group of friends in 2010. 
We’re talking about Bee Cave Bob, an armadillo from Katy, Texas who can predict the changing of the seasons. This is Armadillo Day. The first Armadillo Day took place in 2012 outside of Austin in a town called Bee Cave, which our state legislature officially recognized in 2007 as the honorary location of our planet’s geographical western pole. 
While most Americans look toward Pennsylvania for weather predictions come February 2, Texans are known to look to the Hill Country, at a nine-banded armadillo named Bee Cave Bob. Texas’ Armadillo Day isn’t quite as old as the 137-year-Groundhog Day, but it does boast some uniquely Texan charm. 
In the great history of Texan sayings, there may be none greater than this: “We don’t need no mangy groundhog in Pennsylvania predicting the weather for us.”These famous words were spoken a few years ago by Terry Boothe, who, since 2010, has been challenging Punxsutawney Phil’s meteorological authority with a decidedly more “Texan” critter: an armadillo named Bee Cave Bob. 
Armadillo Day is on Feb. 2 and Bee Cave Bob shared his forecast Wednesday afternoon: an early spring is in store for the Lone Star State. This was in direct opposition to his groundhog counterpart  
The first Armadillo Day took place in 2010 in Bee Cave, which is also called "The West Pole." On May 31, 2007, the Texas state legislature officially recognized the town as our planet’s geographical western pole on the 98th meridian. 
To no ones surprise, Texas does their own thing on Groundhog Day, which they call Armadillo Day. Bee Cave Bob the Armadillo, named after his home town of Bee Cave, Texas, has been in the biz since 2010. If February 2 is a sunny day in Texas and Bob casts a shadow then there will be six more weeks of winter. 
NOTE: Video is from Armadillo Day 2022.. BEE CAVE, Texas – Punxsutawney Phil has been predicting the weather on Feb. 2, also known as “Groundhog Day,” since the 1800s, but in recent years a Texas animal has been making his own predictions.

FULL VIDEO: Bee Cave Bob makes prediction on weather. Instead of a groundhog, Texas has an armadillo. Bee Cave Bob made his prediction on whether we will have a prolonged winter or an early spring.

While Punxsutawney Phil will be making his spring predictions on Groundhog Day, Feb. 2 is known as Armadillo Day in the Texas Hill Country, and an armadillo named Bee Cave Bob will be prognosticating. </p>
