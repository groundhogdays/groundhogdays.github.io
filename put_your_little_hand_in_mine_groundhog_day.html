Babe I got you babe I got you babe. I got you to hold my hand I got you to understand I got you to walk with me I got you to talk with me I got you to kiss goodnight 
So let them say your hair's too long 'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong [Him:] Then put your little hand in mine There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb [Him:] Babe [Both:] I got you babe I got you babe [Him:] I got you to hold my hand [Her:] I got you to understand [Him:] I got you to walk with me [Her:] I got you to talk

"Then put your little hand in mine. There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb. Babe. I got you babe." Happy Groundhog Day, y'all! In honor of the day when a large rodent tells us how much  
They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow Well I don't know if all that's true 'Cause you got me, and baby I got you Babe I got you babe I got you babe They say our love won't pay the rent Before it's earned, our money's all been spent I guess that's so, we don't have a plot But at least I'm sure of all the things

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
A well-loved 1993 film that massively popularised the time loop trope. With Bill Murray at his deadpan best and a much lauded script, the film is considered a modern classic.
