        <p>It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? 
I Got You Babe - Sonny &amp; Cher("Groundhog Day" - "Ricomincio Da Capo", 1993)YOU CAN BUY THE SOUNDTRACK HERE:  CAN BUY THE MOVIE HERE 
A scene from Groundhog Day featuring the song "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere. 
Groundhog Day is anchored by uplifting songs that make a complex foundation for a quirky film. Sonny &amp; Cher’s epochal “I Got You Babe” heralds the dawn in the protagonist's eternal holiday, while “Phil’s Piano Solo” represents his fitful transformation from miserly weatherman to lovable humanist. 
Bob Dylan's use of the word "Babe" in his 1964 song "It Ain't Me Babe" gave Sonny Bono the idea to use it in this song. In the 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray, Murray's character is awakened to this song every morning at precisely 6:00 a.m. on the alarm clock in his hotel room. 
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there. 
Bill Murray can't stop waking up to the Sonny and Cher song "I Got You Babe" in the movie Groundhog Day. Playing the surly weatherman Phil Connors, Murray heads to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, for a familiar ritual: the emergence of Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog that will determine whether or not we'll have six more weeks of winter

Any doubts Danny Rubin had about his dream project were vanquished by Stephen Sondheim, who said “Groundhog Day” would make a good musical. That was in 2003. By then, Rubin and Harold Ramis  
[Verse 1: Bono &amp; Cher] They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow Well I don't know if all that's true 'Cause you got me, and baby, I got you [Chorus: Bono &amp; Both] Babe  
It was very apparent that Cher had the much stronger voice. During the seventies they would have two hit televison variety shows but ultimately divorce. Cher would go on to a long and successful solo career which continues today (2010). Sonny Bono was elected to Congress but died in a ski accident on January 5, 1998. 
The Sonny And Cher song, "I Got You Babe," spent 3 weeks at number one in 1965. Certified Gold and was also number 1 in the UK and Canada. It has been a signature song by Sonny And Cher for many years. Written by Sonny himself in a basement. Sonny was 35 years old, and Cher was 19. Sonny was an up-a 
Bill Murray stars in a new Super Bowl commercial from Jeep, revisiting the world of ‘Groundhog Day’ and featuring the music of Sonny &amp; Cher. 
The brilliance of Groundhog Day is that it manages to put you  right after the closing strains of Sonny and Cher’s relentlessly upbeat “I Got You, Babe,” Murray’s face — and Ramis’s
