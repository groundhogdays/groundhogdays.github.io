        <p>It is uncertain how a groundhog got the role of predicting weather but Phil has been participating in Groundhog Day since 1886 and about 40 other Phil’s by our count.  There’s no Groundhog  
Years later, another incident occurred. During a 2014 Groundhog Day ceremony, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped the animal, who had been secretly replaced with his granddaughter Charlotte. 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
Manitoba Merv has been forecasting since the 1990s, at Oak Hammock Marsh. [106] Winnipeg Wyn has been forecasting since the 2010s, at Prairie Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. [107] Balzac Billy is the "Prairie Prognosticator", a man-sized groundhog mascot who prognosticates weather on Groundhog Day from Balzac, Alberta. [108] 
Deeley declined to share how many groundhog Phil’s there have been, but the average groundhog living in captivity can live up to 10 years, according to the University of Michigan’s Museum of  
Germans watched for badgers to cast shadows; the Pennsylvania Germans chose the groundhog as a "replacement." The first official celebration of Groundhog Day was on February 2, 1886 - and Punxsutawney Phil didn't see his shadow. Phil has seen his shadow 98 times, hasn't seen it 15 times, and there are no records for ten years.

According to the tradition, if Phil sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter-like weather. [1] If Phil does not see his shadow, he has predicted an "early spring." [2] Punxsutawney's event is the most famous of many Groundhog Day festivals held in the United States and Canada. The event formally began  
Phil apparently likes more than just his Groundhog Punch: The groundhog quite memorably announced during Prohibition that, if he were kept from drinking the hard stuff, there would be 60 weeks of  
Dave’s handler, Bob Will, wrote on the site that, as a teacher and wildlife rehabilitator, he would always bring a groundhog into his classroom for Groundhog Day. The local newspaper nicknamed the woodchuck "Dunkirk Dave." Buckeye Chuck – Marion, Ohio. Buckeye Chuck was named Ohio’s official Groundhog Day prognosticator in 1979. 
Groundhog Day began as a tiny event and has grown into an American holiday we can all be proud of. Its furry, buck-toothed star, Punxsutawney Phil, has visited the White House and even met Oprah. 
It’s a great way to involve kids or friends in the fun. Let everyone get creative with their edible groundhogs and have a mini taste test. 5. Throw a Celebrate Groundhog Day Costume Party.
