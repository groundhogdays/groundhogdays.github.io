        <h2><strong>groundhog day musical story groundhog day socks</strong></h2>
        <p>The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Synopsis. A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Synopsis: Groundhog Day follows Phil Connors, a weatherman, who finds himself stuck living the same day over and over in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. As Phil navigates the repetition of events, he undergoes a transformative journey of self-discovery, learning about love, kindness, and the true meaning of life. 
In spite of his protests, Phil is forced to travel to Punxsutawney, where the townspeople hope that the groundhog sees his shadow on the morrow, signifying an early arrival of spring for the year (“There Will Be Sun”). Phil wakes up the morning of February 2--Groundhog Day--in an even more foul temper than before.

Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within.

If it weren't for Rita Hanson (Barrett Doss), Groundhog: Day The Musical would be an even bleaker affair.The musical explores the dark depths of Rubin's original story to the fullest extent. A  
Yet the best things about Groundhog Day the musical are when the strangeness of the town, and Phil's extreme, snarled responses to it, are left on full, jangling boil. 
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self
