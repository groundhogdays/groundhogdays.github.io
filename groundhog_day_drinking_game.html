You’re gonna need to catch up by drinking the prescribed amount of Straub Groundhog Brew every time you see the following cliches: DRINK FOR 5 SECONDS any time some dork mentions the movie Groundhog Day or tosses out some tired-ass Bill Murray reference.

Just in time for tomorrow, I have compiled the definitive Groundhog Day movie drinking game rules.

DRINKING RULES FOR GROUNDHOG DAY: Whenever the alarm clock turns 6:00 AM (the day loops back again) Any time you hear the name “Punxsutawney” Every time physical harm comes to Bill Murray (e.g. slaps, suicides) FINISH YOUR DRINK WHEN: Larry (Chris Elliot) says “Would you be interested in seeing the inside of a van?” LISTEN HERE OR DOWNLOAD:

Groundhog Day doesn’t have to be just another winter day—it’s such a fun excuse to get crafty and play a few games! With these 23+ ideas, you’ll have plenty of ways to keep the kids engaged and smiling, whether you’re at home or in the classroom. 
The Groundhog Day drinking game! The rules are simple. Watch the film and drink whenever they say groundhog, and drink whenever its a new day. 
The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with Punxsutawney Phil the grand master of a celebration that draws thousands to the annual morning ritual. And yes people start drinking earlyWhy not? Groundhog Day – The Movie &amp; Drinking Games. Watching the movie Groundhog Day is a crucial part of celebrating  
I could go on forever about what makes Groundhog Day great, but with regard to the time loop in particular, what’s striking is how incredibly ordinary that repeating day is. It’s full of minor discomforts: Phil (Bill Murray) is away from home at a cheesy B&amp;B, the weather is brutal, his job is banal, and his coworkers are annoying. 
What may be getting overlooked is the day after the Super Bowl. No not National Pretend to be Sick and Call Off Work Day! It’s Groundhog’s Day! Naturally, drinking must accompany an occasion of this caliber. But since we will be piss drunk and hungover from the Super Bowl at 6 in the morning, we will drink to the movie Groundhog’s Day.
