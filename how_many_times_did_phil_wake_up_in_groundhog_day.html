        <h2><strong>how many times did phil wake up in groundhog day cmat groundhog day chords</strong></h2>
        <p>The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Tom Dunkel, explained to WTAJ. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That  
No, Groundhog Day is not based on a true story. It is a work of fiction written by Danny Rubin. 2. How many times does Phil Connors repeat Groundhog Day? Although it is never explicitly mentioned, it is estimated that Phil repeats Groundhog Day for approximately 10,000 days. 3. Does Phil Connors remember each day he repeats? 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
According to WhatCulture, Phil only spent 33 years and 350 days repeating the same day over and over again, or 12,395 times to be exact. P.S. In case you were wondering, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow earlier today, and so we get an early spring! 
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day." According to their findings, Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a period totaling eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
How many times did Bill Murray wake up in Groundhog Day? Well a film blog has worked it out for you: 33 years and 350 days. WhatCulture.com worked out just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film’s 20th anniversary. 
In which case, the number of Groundhog Days that Phil looped through could be greatly increased if he wakes up at 6A every morning and it resets at midnight, then at most he can only experience 18 hours per day, meaning he needs to wake up to 5 mornings just to accumulate 4 full days of experience. 
While the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club says Phil is correct 100% of the time, according to the StormFax Weather Almanac, Phil has an overall accuracy rate of 39% over 135 years.

Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there. 
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] </p>
