"Groundhog Day is a film that resonates with audiences on a deep level. It‘s a story about the power of self-reflection, personal growth, and the importance of living each day to the fullest." – Roger Ebert, film critic. The movie‘s popularity had a significant impact on the real-life Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney.

The town was also the same location where the original movie was shot. But it also almost didn’t happen. Francois realized last fall that the Super Bowl and Groundhog Day would be occurring on the same day for only the second time in 54 years.

The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. </p>
