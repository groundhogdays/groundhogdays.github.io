There's something familiar about Larry the camera guy in Groundhog Day — y'know, beside the fact that you see him do and say the same things on repeat.  And then there's Larry the cameraman  
After Groundhog Day, Doyle-Murray appeared in Bakersfield P.D. and The George Wendt Show in the mid-'90s, going on to pick up roles in As Good as It Gets (1997), Snow Dogs (2002), and 17 Again (2009). 
The actor was then cast as Larry the cameraman in Groundhog Day. After that, his career continued to flourish - he became a cast member of Saturday Night Live in 1994, and he landed his first on  
Larry is Phil’s cameraman accompanying him to the Groundhog Day ceremony. He does little to facilitate the process of redeeming Phil, but is effective at making Phil look better on occasion. Ned Ryerson 
Since Groundhog Day is on Wednesday, we decided to see where the cast of the hit movie is nearly 30 years later.  Chris Elliott stars as Phil's cameraman, Larry. Chris Elliott (right) starred  
In 1993's 'Groundhog Day', Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott shared the screen.  Chris Elliot (Larry the Cameraman) Chris Elliot is most known for his film roles in Groundhog Day  
Sarcastic and jaded weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is tasked with covering Punxsutawney's annual Groundhog Day events. With cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) in tow, he travels to the Western  
A narcissistic TV weatherman, along with his attractive-but-distant producer, and his mawkish cameraman, is sent to report on Groundhog Day in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself repeating the same day over and over. 
These 'Groundhog Day' cast photos show Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and more today in 2022.  Phil’s cameraman, Larry, was played by Chris Elliott, who also traveled to Punxsutawney alongside  
The biggest look we get into Larry's mind is when he's at the bar hitting on Nancy. Nancy is clearly not interested but Larry is clueless. He just rambles on about how he's misunderstood as a cameraman because people think he just points his camera at stuff. But as he insists, LARRY: There is a lot more to it than just that. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
1. Larry the Cameraman (Chris Elliott) plays the proverbial third wheel in the 1993 classic Groundhog Day opposite the leads, weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his on-location producer  
In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local newspaper, Weathers Wags, according to the club. In 1887, the first official pilgrimage to see Phil on Gobbler  
These attempts, along with a couple of musical choices, may be the only thing in Groundhog Day that has aged badly. (Although, to be fair, the film doesn’t seem to be condoning his behaviour here – in fact, he is repeatedly rebuffed. With only a day to play with, he is simply moving too fast.) Then comes emptiness. The void. Solitude. 
The Metaphysics of Groundhog Day Lawrence Crocker says it’s about time, and personal identity, and free will. The 1993 movie Groundhog Day was, of course, made as an exploration of the metaphysics of time. The basic idea is that for on-location TV weatherman Phil Connors, the same Groundhog Day, February 2, in Punxsutawney keeps repeating. 
10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13. When does a groundhog come before a woodchuck? In the dictionary. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world.
