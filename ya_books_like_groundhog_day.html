Just in time for Groundhog’s Day (the holiday), we have a list of great time loop novels like Groundhog’s Day (the movie)! Just kidding! If you’re familiar with the 1993 film, you know that reporter Bill Murray gets stuck in a small town covering the news about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who may or may not see his shadow.

In honor of Groundhog Day, we’ve pulled together 15 books that play with the “Groundhog Day” theme of repeating time. A lot of these books are rom coms or YA rom coms (who doesn’t wish for a do-over in love sometimes, especially teenage love?), but there are also mysteries, historical fiction and more where the protagonist is stuck  
Their best friend is confused when they say they feel like they’ve lived this day before. It’s just deja vu. But moment after moment, the same things happen. They go to bed, thinking it was just a weird day. Boom! The same song plays. They’re living the same day, and this time it’s not a coincidence. They’re trapped! 
What is a time loop book? Think of it as a story that repeats itself over and over, much like the famed movie, Groundhog Day. It can also be a book that starts and finishes on the same day without necessarily doing multiple repeats. These stories can be loads of fun or utterly flop. The trick is in the scenarios the writer is conveying. 
Popularized by the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, the “Groundhog Day” trope continues to appear in books and films, notably in the YA genre. Close Search for: Search

So it's like going back in time and re-doing the day in like five different ways. It's not like groundhog day really since she doesn't know what happened in the other timelines and can't learn from them. I don't like it quite as much as Cashore's other books (Graceling Realm) but it's definitely a unique book and worth reading. 
The 1993 classic film ‘Groundhog Day’ popularized the trope of time loops in modern media. Here are 4 books that feature time loops of adventure! 
By: Lauren Oliver | 470 pages | Published: 2010 | Popular Shelves: young-adult, ya, contemporary, books-i-own, fiction. For popular high school senior Samantha Kingston, February 12—"Cupid Day"—should be one big party, a day of valentines and roses and the privileges that come with being at the top of the social pyramid. 
Other thing that fascinate me is timetravel, or books with plot like groundhog day. where the main character relive the same day/period over and over again. The sad part is that i think i have read all the best books on these topic. Id rather not read a young adult book. Any and all suggestions are welcomed with open arms :) 
It is becoming clearer and clearer that Groundhog Day (1993), directed by Harold Ramis, is one of the masterpieces of 1990s Hollywood cinema.One of the first films to use a science-fiction premise as 
Quote from wikipedia "Harold Ramis, who directed Groundhog Day, found the meaning of Strange Life of Ivan Osokin similar to the existential dilemma of Groundhog Day. Both works imply that a sober acceptance of personal accountability is necessary in order to effect an increase in the degree of freedom of the individual. 
This is a reverse harem / high school bully romance, so absolutely not to everyone's taste, but Devil's Day by C.M. Stunich is pretty much Groundhog Day with the heroine stuck in a time loop. You really go into the heroine's attempts to figure out the rules, and then explore the various triggers/directions her day can go.
