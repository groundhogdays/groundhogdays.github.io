Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
What made Murray so unhappy with a movie that boasted a smart, funny script? Well, several factors came into play.  Despite his rumored distaste for the film, Murray saw Groundhog Day on Broadway. 
Roger Ebert, in Groundhog Day in Chicago Sun-Times (12 February 1993) Groundhog Day is a film that finds its note and purpose so precisely that its genius may not be immediately noticeable.
