        <p>As the folks in Punxsutawney say, it’s “A day to take everything a little less seriously, and break up the winter monotony at least for a little while!” What is the Meaning Behind Groundhog Day? Imbolc Origins. Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
In his 2003 book Groundhog Day, folklorist Don Yoder traces the roots of Groundhog Day to the same cycle of pre-Christian festivals that gave us Halloween and Mayday, the Library of Congress cites. 
"Today the Germans say the groundhog comes out of his winter quarters," read the diary entry, "and if he sees his shadow he returns in and remains there 40 days." 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The "Punxsutawney Groundhog Club" was founded in 1886 by a group of groundhog hunters, one of whom was the editor of the town's newspaper and quickly published a proclamation about its local  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Punxsutawney Phil – the famous groundhog weather watcher – woke up and did not see his shadow Friday morning, calling for an early spring. Each February 2, on Groundhog Day, the members of the  
Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow in front of thousands of spectators Friday morning at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, part of the annual Groundhog Day tradition celebrated  
What did Punxsutawney Phil say? Per tradition, the crowd was lead by about a dozen members of Phil's "Inner Circle," a group of men in top hats who organize the event each year.  Groundhog Day
