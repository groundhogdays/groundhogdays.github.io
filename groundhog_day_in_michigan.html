        <p>Join the Howell Nature Center on Groundhog Day as Woody, Michigan’s OFFICIAL groundhog, makes her prediction LIVE! Will we have six more weeks of winter? Or will we have an early spring? The day will start at 7:30 am with a free continental breakfast in our Pineview Lodge, some fun groundhog games, and learn all about groundhogs from our knowledgeable wildlife staff. Plus, a Groundhog Day  
However, Woody's weather-predicting style is a little different than Phil's. According to weather tracker Groundhog-Day.com,. Unlike the ‘shadow’ technique used by most groundhogs, Woody’s forecast is determined by the time she spends outside on a ceremonial tree stump: 30 seconds or longer means an early spring, any less means a chilly six more weeks of winter. 
The 2024 Howell Groundhog Day Celebration in 2024 takes place Friday, Feb. 2 from 7:30 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. It kicks off with a costume contest for kids, who can come to the event dressed as winter, spring, a groundhog or any other costumes that fit the theme of the day. The winner receives a $25 Nature Center gift certificate. 
Woody the Woodchuck, Michigan’s official groundhog who resides at the Howell Nature Center, has had a nearly 70% accuracy rate in her predictions.  Woody was back at it again on Groundhog Day  
Woody the Woodchuck, a female groundhog, is set to give her 27th prediction in front of a live audience around 8:30 a.m. for Groundhog Day on Sunday, Feb. 2, at the Howell Nature Center, 1005  
The groundhog arrived at the Howell Nature Center in 1998 and began to forecast the weather in 1999. Since then, Woody has had 16 correct predictions, according to the Howell Nature Center. 
The day will start at 7:30 am with a free continental breakfast in our Pineview Lodge, some fun groundhog games, and learn all about groundhogs from our knowledgeable wildlife staff. Plus a Groundhog Day Costume Contest where you could win a $25 gift certificate to HNC! Then we’ll see if Woody predicts an early spring or six more weeks of winter. 
Michigan's own seasonal predictor will make her 24th annual prediction LIVE at the Howell Nature Center. The address is 1005 Triangle Lake Rd.  There was also a Groundhog Day costume contest  
Woody is the state’s official groundhog. It is her 26th year predicting if spring will come early. On Friday, she predicts six more weeks of winter in Michigan. 
Friday is Groundhog Day, and the legend has it that if the groundhog sees its shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. If there is no shadow, spring is right around the corner. 
Groundhog Day is on its way and if Punxsutawney Phil or Michigan's Woody the Woodchuck don't see their shadows this year, we could see an early spring, the folk tale says.. Since the 1800s

About Woody. Woody the Woodchuck, Michigan’s official clairvoyant groundhog, has been prognosticating for over 2 decades.
