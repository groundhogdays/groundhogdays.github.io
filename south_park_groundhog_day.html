See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

Look up Tim Minchin, the guy who wrote the music to Groundhog Day and Matilda. His music is incredible and he puts on a great live show. Most of his stuff are kind of South Park style humor, smart but crass, so it's not as clean as his Broadway work but still really good. White Wine in the Sun is my absolute favorite Christmas song (it's clean) 
Xena repeats the day once again until she mends everything. Although this plot is fairly common, the producers acknowledged a connection to Groundhog Day specifically. "South Park" Are You There God?

When Fletcher Studio first began work on San Francisco’s South Park, the initial design was developed “through iterative analogue diagramming” 1 with a focus on “an intuitive understanding of the site and embedded in an analogue rule set.” 2 This rule set was derived from on-the-ground observations, where the designers observed and

The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

Hence the old Scottish couplet which long  
To get to the Wildlife Center from I-79 North, take Exit 99 and follow US-48/US-33 East for 12 miles to Buckhannon, and follow WV-20 South for 12 miles. From I-79 South, take Exit 67 at Flatwoods and follow US-19/WV-4 North approximately 30 miles to Rock Cave. Be sure to bear right to stay on WV-4 North at the US-19/WV-4 Junction. 
Dressed sharply in a top hat and bow tie, Orphie has made annual predictions since 1926, with a record of 73 predictions (79%) for six more weeks of winter and 19 (21%) for an early spring. 
Kyle’s mind would revolve around the potential suspects when it comes to finding the culprit. He didn’t think that he wouldn’t be the only person in all of South Park to ever remember Stan’s death. Or the loop that Kyle had found himself in, for whatever reason.

One random day - an average day in South Park, with a thick layer of snow coating the ground and a harsh chill in the air - Kenny McCormick died. That wasn’t the last time it happened, believe it or not. It came out of the blue. The 8-year-old boy walked to the bus stop with his friends Stan, Kyle, and Cartman. 
If I was stuck in an endless Groundhog Day loop of immortality, I would just take the piss and let people underestimate me so I could go off and do my own thing with minimal interference, too. Kenny's also a hedonist that loves having dumb fun and is smarter than he seems, which is pretty obvious when you take his occupation and appearance from  </p>
