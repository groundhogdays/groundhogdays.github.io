The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development.

Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day.

12 Dates of Christmas is a festive version of Groundhog Day with maybe a bit of A Christmas Carol thrown in. Amy Smart is reliving her Christmas Eve as she wakes up each time on the floor of a department store. She is selfish, self obsessed and rude. 
Now, obviously, a time loop movie is a great premise for horror flicks or sci-fi thrillers. But if you like the slice-of-life or comedy aspect of Groundhog Day then the next movie is something you can try out. This movie may not be for everyone because as you can guess from the title it is a Christmas movie.
