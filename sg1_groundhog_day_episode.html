        <p>Window of Opportunity: Directed by Peter DeLuise. With Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c realize they and their friends are trapped in a time loop. 
Other reviewers found the episode "hilarious" [14] and "a fine example of SG-1 at its humorous best". [15] The 2000 XPosé Yearbook ranked "Window of Opportunity" as the second-best episode of science fiction television in the year 2000. [16] A sampling of fan opinions on space.com in 2001 showed the episode as a "clear favorite". [17] 
"Window of Opportunity" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of Stargate SG-1. On a routine mission to P4X-639, SG-1 meets an alien archaeologist Malakai operating an Ancient device. Malakai has his own motives and causes a time loop, where only Colonel Jack O'Neill and Teal'c notice. Furthermore, convincing the rest they are trapped in a time loop and that they have to return to the  
Specifically, Jack and Teal'c who, in past episodes, have relied on Carter and Daniel to handle the science and Ancient, and suddenly find themselves having to step into their team members' shoes. Yes, it's our version of Groundhog Day but it works because the time-loop conceit is secondary to the heart of this story: the characters.

The fourth season episode mixes heart and camaraderie with some of the show’s funniest moments. Co-writer and producer Joseph Mallozzi talked about the episode in his recent appearance on “Dial the Gate,” revealing the origins of this story and how it turned into both a comedic and emotional tour de force.

Groundhog Day was a popular movie on Earth involving a time loop. While trapped in a time loop by Malakai, Colonel Jack O'Neill asked Malikai if he was attempting to become the king of Groundhog Day. (SG1: "Window of Opportunity") 
Stargate SG-1's version of Groundhog Day was thoroughly entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud frequently. Yet this episode was not the comic book that "Upgrades" was. A recurring loop of time is at least more plausible than the superhuman powers experienced by the team in "Upgrades." 
Memory Wipe Exploitation: Jack and Teal'c are caught in a "Groundhog Day" Loop and eventually decide to take advantage of the lack of consequences. Ranging from using the stargate as a driving range to Jack not-quite violating the fraternization rules with Carter (he hands in his resignation first and then immediately goes to find Carter and

While this premise can often be labeled gimmicky, a good script can make these episodes a great way to deliver mystery and character development through smart use of its time loops.

I really had fun watching this episode. It's a variation of "Groundhog Day", which is obviously not a new idea but still worked out nicely. I guess it's Col. O'Neill's dry humor and Teal'c's stoic mannerisms that really do the trick. 
Is “Window of Opportunity” the greatest episode of Stargate ever? It’s certainly been a top-ranked favorite episode among fans ever since it first aired on August 4, 2000. Stargate SG-1 co-creator Brad Wright and The Companion are set to celebrate the episode in a special livestream event this Saturday, October 21, at The Companion. The  
The "Groundhog Day" episode was on last week and now it's on again right now. It's one of my favorites, but twice in one week?

"Wormhole X-Treme!" is a polarizing episode for the fandom, due in part to its awkward placement in the series. The fifth season of Stargate: SG-1 is far from its best, and many people took  
Stargate SG1’s was fantastic, with Col. O’Neill (“with two L’s”) and Teal’c trapped in the time loop.  Charmed has an outstanding Groundhog Day episode  </p>
