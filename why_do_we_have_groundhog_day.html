        <h2><strong>why do we have groundhog day groundhog day the musical tim minchin</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

3 of 15 | . FILE - The groundhog saw his shadow, Feb. 2, 1954, as the sun peeked through an overcast sky at Washington Park Zoo in Milwaukee, Wis. The arrival of annual Groundhog Day celebrations Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, will draw thousands of people to see celebrity woodchuck Phil at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa. — an event that exploded in popularity after the 1993 Bill Murray movie. 
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
"Groundhog Day is a reminder that even in the midst of the coldest, bleakest times, we can find joy and laughter in the simple things. It‘s a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit." – Dr. Lisa Thompson, psychologist. In many ways, the themes of the "Groundhog Day" movie mirror the enduring appeal of the tradition itself. 
But why do we check in on the shadow of a groundhog in the deep of winter each year?  Following the popularity of the 1993 Bill Murray movie "Groundhog Day," the event increased in popularity  
The History of Groundhog Day. The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
It has probably never really made sense–which is probably why you’re wondering why we have Groundhog Day. Further Reading: Groundhog Day: Punxsutawney Phil Facts. Candlemas. No, it’s not the same as Christmas, but it does still fall under the banner of Christian holidays. Conveniently, it also falls on the same day as Groundhog Day. 
But why do we check in on the shadow of a groundhog in the deep of winter each year?  Following the popularity of the 1993 Bill Murray movie "Groundhog Day," the event increased in popularity  
In reality, groundhogs don’t make the best meteorologists, and poor Punxsutawney Phil doesn’t have a great track record. As of 2022, he’d made the right call just 39% of the time, according  
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
While Groundhog Day is a long-celebrated tradition, first occuring in its current location of Gobbler's Knob in 1887, the 1993 film “Groundhog Day” has long been thought to be the reason

When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow.

But why do we celebrate Groundhog Day anyway? It seems a little silly to take wardrobe advice from a celebrity rodent, especially a rodent who is literally wrong more than half of the time. 
Plus, human meteorologists have far more advanced methods for predicting the weather now than they did when Phil first got the gig in 1887.
