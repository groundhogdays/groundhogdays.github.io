In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
A look at how Groundhog Day got started -- and why Punxsutawney Phil and his shadow became so popular.  History and facts of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil. Updated: Apr. 26, 2024, 8:10 p  
America has been looking to Punxsutawney Phil for over 130 years to indicate whether or not we'll have a short or long winter. But Groundhog Day goes back way further than that. Here's the complete history of the holiday, as well as when it is and how Punxsutawney Phil came to be. 
The Stormfax Almanac has made note of the weather conditions on each Groundhog Day since 1999; the almanac has recorded 12 incidents in a 20-year span in which the Inner Circle said the groundhog saw his shadow while the sky was cloudy or there was rain or snow coming down, and in one case said the groundhog did not see his shadow despite  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter.

The History of Groundhog Day The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that.

The Legacy of "Groundhog Day" (1993) The popularity of Groundhog Day skyrocketed in 1993 with the release of the movie "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again in Punxsutawney. 
Groundhog Day has a rich history based on a deeper meaning; it speaks to the triumph of spring over winter—and birth over death. Again, note the appearance of light over dark with the appearance of candles and dawn—and, of course, the spiritual light of a holier presence. 
Groundhog Day has its roots in another February 2 celebration. Groundhog Day is an offshoot of the Christian celebration of Candlemas, which is held every February 2—exactly 40 days after  
European Origins. The origins of Groundhog Day date back to medieval Europe. The day of 2 February corresponds with Candlemas, a Christian festival (see Religious Festivals) during which candles are lit, hence the celebration’s name. </p>
