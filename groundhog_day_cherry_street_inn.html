The Cherry Tree Inn, located in Woodstock, Illinois, is a charming bed-and-breakfast best known for its role in the 1993 film Groundhog Day. In the movie, the inn is portrayed as the fictional "Cherry Street Inn," where Bill Murray's character, Phil Connors, repeatedly wakes up each morning as he relives the same day over and over. 
Fans of Groundhog Day will immediately recognize the Cherry Tree Inn as the “Cherry Street Inn,” where Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) wakes up each day to Sonny &amp; Cher’s “I Got You Babe”. The inn’s elegant exterior and cozy interiors set the stage for some of the film’s most memorable moments. 
If you’re looking for a fun thing to do, I’d recommend doing a self-guided Groundhog Day movie walking tour. All the movie spots have plaques to indicate where it took place. The Cherry Tree Inn has one too!Look for the Groundhog Day plaque on the arch as you walk to the front of the home. Final Thoughts of Cherry Tree Inn

My wife and I stayed at the Cherry Tree Inn in late October 2023. The experience was everything we had hoped for. As big fans of the film, Groundhog Day, and the annual folk music festival held every July, we had visited Woodstock on numerous day trips over the years, but had yet to stay at the Cherry Tree Inn since it became a real bed &amp; breakfast.
