        <p>RELATED: Groundhog Day: 5 Ways Phil Connors Is Bill Murray's Best Character (&amp; 5 Alternatives) The 90s were a great decade for romantic comedies, but it can be argued quite convincingly that the genre-bending Groundhog Day is the best of the bunch. To watch it once is to watch it over and over again, which makes its replay value all the more  
For many people around the globe, February 2nd is when they celebrate an important ritual – watching Bill Murray berate poor Chris Elliot in Groundhog Day. Recently during one of my many viewings, I hit upon a sudden realization– Groundhog Day just might be the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Sure, I love Annie Hall, Say Anything 
First, if a rom com needs to end happy to be one, then Groundhog Day accomplishes that. I will also need to rewatch Sleepless. But to be clear, I didn’t say a rom-com needed development, I’m saying a rom-com is improved by development. So Clueless, Groundhog Day, Eternal Sunshine 
Yes, it’s kind of strange to think that the ancient Celts were actually responsible for spawning generation after generation of groundhog weather gurus. One can only wonder what they would think of a bunch of men in top hats pulling Phil from his burrow. Or about the movie Groundhog Day. Which, by the way, is always worth watching again. 
Form: Groundhog Day follows a clear narrative line, with plot development, a climax, resolution and all that good stuff. However, what sets it apart from other films (and what makes it so damned special) is its quirky central premise – that the same day is being repeated over, and over, and over (and over) again. 
With a quirky romantic comedy and a gimmicky sci-fi premise, “Groundhog Day” managed to tap into universal, spiritual, larger than life questions. 
I just replied to someone in a different groundhog day thread earlier today and suggested 12:01pm. I remember thinking of that short while sitting in the theater watching groundhog day the moment I realized what was happening. 
That’s right. One of the catalysts that inspired my love of romance was the classic Bill Murray movie, “Groundhog Day.” While I won’t say it’s the sole reason for me becoming a romantic, seeing this movie marked a turning point for me. It marked the first time I enjoyed a movie because of its romantic sub-plot and not in spite of it. 
Genre-defining classics like “Sleepless in Seattle” and “Groundhog Day” are always solid picks, as they are both critically-acclaimed and quench the thirst for romance. 1995’s  
Groundhog Day is a textbook execution of this formula. The transformation of Phil Connors, from a rude jerk to a public hero, is a class of its own. Although the entire film is an incredibly funny comedy, its wisdom and simplicity in conveying life’s most important truths should be appreciated. A smart comedy is an extremely difficult genre. 
Bill Murray in Ground Hog Day . Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities.

菲尔（Bill Murray饰）是个气象播报员，每天除了在摄像机前给观众做风趣幽默的天气预报外，每年的2月2日他还要前往一个名为普苏塔尼的边境小镇，报导当地的土拨鼠日庆典。 事实上，菲尔对这一节日相当

Will the Groundhog See His Shadow in 2025? According to our weather predictions, February 2, 2025, will bring snow showers and cold weather. We think that when Punxsutawney Phil—that Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Weather Prognosticator Extraordinary— emerges from his burrow (with a little help from his handlers) to make his much-anticipated forecast, he will NOT see his shadow, which
