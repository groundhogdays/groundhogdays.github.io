        <p>The world premiere of Groundhog Day a new musical directed by Old Vic Artistic Director Matthew Warchus.. Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors (Andy Karl), a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the isolated small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when he finds himself caught in a time loop, forced to repeat the same day again and

Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin.  After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London,  
The critically acclaimed hit show, Groundhog Day, directed by Matthew Warchus, with book by Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tim Minchin will return to The Old Vic from 20 May–12 August 2023. Andy Karl will reprise his Olivier Award-winning role as the cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors in a 12-week run. 
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
Groundhog Day will be performed at the Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August, with a press performance on 8 June. The show has received critical acclaim during its initial run, being described by Sarah Crompton as “a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving.” 
The Old Vic has revealed the full creative team and cast for the award-winning musical, Groundhog Day, which returns to London following its world premiere in 2016. The original production's lead

Groundhog Day, appropriately, is back where it started. The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen. 
Warchus brings Groundhog Day to the Old Vic as part of his inaugural season as Artistic Director, with performances due to begin in July, playing until September 17th 2016. Don’t miss out on this entirely original, exciting new musical! Child Friendly. Groundhog Day is packed with plenty of laughs, but may not be suitable for very young children.

Groundhog Day had its world premiere and enjoyed a critically acclaimed strictly limited 10 week season at The Old Vic Theatre, London, in the summer of 2016.. One of the most ambitious shows ever to have been staged at The Old Vic, previews began on the 15th July. 
On paper, the happy new musical “Groundhog Day,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Old Vic Theater here, seemed like one of those shows that elicit instant groans of “been there, done
