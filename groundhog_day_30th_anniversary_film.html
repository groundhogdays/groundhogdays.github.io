This weekend marks a big anniversary for one classic comedy. Bill Murray's "Groundhog Day" came out 30 years ago! The iconic film took place in Woodstock. Bu 
That’s right campers, it’s the 30th anniversary of the movie “Groundhog Day.” The premise is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he learns to become a better human — causing his  
To celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, the film was released in select theaters for two days in February 2023, with one of those days being February 2, Groundhog Day. [ 126 ] Analysis 
After 30 years, ‘Groundhog Day’ holds up, and you can say that again  but in the name of research for this celebration of the 30th anniversary of one of the great comedies of all time, I am  
While “Groundhog Day” is set in the iconic town of Punxsutawney, Pa., the movie was actually filmed in Woodstock, Ill., located about 50 miles from Bill Murray’s hometown of Wilmette, Ill

Snowed in during a trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) finds himself stuck in time, endlessly repeating February 2nd. His world is inhabited by the same people every day, but they don't know Groundhog Day is repeating itself. 
Snowed in during a trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) finds himself stuck in time, endlessly repeating February 2nd. His world is inhabited by the same people every day, but they don't know Groundhog Day is repeating itself. That gives him a certain advantage: He can find out what a woman is  
As a child, Groundhog Day was always a fun and light-hearted holiday, but little did I know that it would become a beloved film that has stood the test of time. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the iconic movie, and it’s hard to believe it has been three decades since we first met Phil Connors and his endless loop of February 2nd. 
The new 30th Anniversary 4K UHD Blu-Ray of Groundhog Day offers a tremendous uptick in quality over the accompanying 15th Anniversary Blu-Ray. The film was already released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray five years ago, but I have not had the pleasure of checking out that release.

In keeping with Sony’s string of SteelBook 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray releases, Groundhog Day is the latest to score the slightly improved Dolby Vision treatment. As I said in my 2018 4K review, the film looks great but given the drab wintery vibe it’s not exactly a title that’s going to blow your hair back but it’s certainly better than past Blu-ray and DVD releases.

Groundhog Day is a simple film at heart. It’s a story about a scrooge type character who has to be faced with his own flaws in order to overcome them. Instead of Christmas ghosts coming to guide him through the journey, Phil is stuck in the same place so much that this single repeating day is the equivalent of a mirror being thrust in front  
Audio: 4.5/5 This is the same Dolby Atmos mix that appeared on the 25 th Anniversary release:. Sony has given Groundhog Day an audio upgrade to Dolby Atmos, which some may scratch their heads and wonder what Atmos could add to what both Ron Epstein in his 2002 DVD review and Richard Gallagher in his 2009 Blu-ray review said were sonic improvements in the DVD’s Dolby Digital 5.1 and Blu-ray
