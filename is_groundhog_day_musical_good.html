        <p>Ultimately, ‘Groundhog Day’ is a surprisingly profound exploration of how to live a good life by appreciating the wonder and specialness in the everyday: Rob Howell's beautifully detailed set  
Look up Tim Minchin, the guy who wrote the music to Groundhog Day and Matilda. His music is incredible and he puts on a great live show. Most of his stuff are kind of South Park style humor, smart but crass, so it's not as clean as his Broadway work but still really good. White Wine in the Sun is my absolute favorite Christmas song (it's clean)

Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
Groundhog Day: The Musical is a rousing, feel-good experience, albeit one filled with misery and death. But how else do you appreciate the good things if you don't suffer through the bad? 
If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." 
Incredibly deft handling of tone, possibly the best I've seen in a musical. The balance between comedy and darkness has to be perfect. I do think the extent of its excellence doesn't come across from listening to the soundtrack, though, so maybe it's harder to get hyped about before seeing it. 
The musical Groundhog Day is far more reflective of Minchin’s comedy than anyone else’s, it even manages to work in a musical dig at alternative therapies almost apropos of nothing, to really  
Stephen Sondheim once thought about turning the 1993 film “Groundhog Day” into a stage musical. He gave up on the idea, saying: “It cannot be improved. It’s perfect the way it is.” 
Andy Karl, center, is the burned-out weatherman Phil Connors, trapped in a small Pennsylvania town, in the musical “Groundhog Day.”  These, of course, include the love of a good woman, who

The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
Synopsis. A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Rockford, Ill (WTVO) — Groundhog Day is just a few days away, and before the groundhog determines if we’ll have six more weeks for winter or an early Spring, he’s making Lovebug cocktails wit 
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
The fact that there are so few songs that make good marketing is frankly a testament to the good intentions of the musical's creators, that the focus was on making the songs that were right for the drama, not for the marketing team. At the same time, the musical's great strength may also have been the thing that killed it commercially. 
Seven years later, Groundhog Day is making its triumphant return to the Old Vic, with Karl reprising his award-winning role. London audiences now have the opportunity to see this breathtaking show once more! Groundhog Day reunites most of the creative team behind Matilda the Musical, including music and lyrics by Australian comedian Tim 
“Groundhog Day: the Musical is an instant classic – and could be better than the movie”  It’s marvelously good funand Karl is a magnetic leading man.”  
The premise of “Groundhog Day,” both the movie and the musical, is well-known: Cynical television weather forecaster Phil Connors, covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney  </p>
