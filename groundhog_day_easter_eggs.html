        <h2><strong>groundhog day easter eggs how was groundhog day created</strong></h2>
        <p>We share Groundhog Day's offscreen story, and some fun Easter eggs. This Harold Ramis-Bill Murray time-traveling comedy is an absolute classic. We share Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day. This classic movie about Deja vu is honored by google. When you search “groundhog day” you will see google ask you “did you mean: groundhog day”, linking to the same page over and over again. 7. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The knowledge panel, when you search for “fresh prince of belair“, will display a license plate  
"In Groundhog Day, when Phil starts helping people, he tries to save the old man but is informed at the hospital that the old man died. In the background, you see the kid who falls out of the tree  
Groundhog Day is here which means it’s time to watch the 1993 movie Groundhog Day instead of the news that we’re getting 6 more weeks of winter. Bill Murray’s time loop comedy will make you feel better about being stuck in the same day for the past year. This is the most topical movie of the COVID era. 
The groundhog hunter. In 1887, a group of Pennsylvania groundhog hunters took to calling themselves the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. One of them, a newspaper editor, declared on February 2, 1887: you could search far and wide but their groundhog “Phil” was the only True weather forecasting rodent. 
[Easter Egg] Similarly to the "recursion" easter egg, searching "Groundhog Day" on Google always results in the program asking if you meant exactly what you typed. Clicking it essentially causes an infinite loop much like the 1993 Bill Murray comedy of the same name. 
The result of multiple Easter eggs may be calculated; for example: "the number of horns on a unicorn plus the answer to life the universe and everything ( see it)" will return "43". Ahead of Pi Day 2021, Google added an Easter egg game to the calculator tool which tested players' knowledge and memory of Pi. Image search 
13. Crowds of up to 40,000 people have attended the Groundhog Day celebration. Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, home to under 6,000 residents, hosts the largest Groundhog Day celebration, attracting an average of 20,000 people annually. The 1993 movie ‘Groundhog Day’ significantly boosted attendance, with a record 40,000 attendees in 2020. 
The groundhog hunter. In 1887, a group of Pennsylvania groundhog hunters took to calling themselves the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. One of them, a newspaper editor, declared on February 2, 1887: you could search far and wide but their groundhog “Phil” was the only True weather forecasting rodent. 
The easter egg is also likely a nod at Bill Murray's 1993 filmÂ Groundhog Day, which features a time loop similar to the one that Doctor Strange employs in his battle against Dormammu at the end of the film. Taking place every February 2nd, Groundhog Day is a superstitious event said to predict the coming of Spring.

#1 Groundhog’s Day.  This is one of the most useful Easter eggs in the game – most of them are pretty useless, but this is one meta puzzle we won’t forget. #2 The Egg Song. 
We have all enjoyed the genre over the years, so let’s take a look back on the original with this list of 15 facts you might not have known about the Bill Murray classic, Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was not filmed in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The movie might have been set in Pennsylvania, but it was actually filmed in Woodstock, Illinois  
A list of 27 films compiled on Letterboxd, including Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019), Parasite (2019), Fight Club (1999), Groundhog Day (1993) and The Death of Stalin (2017). 
A narcissistic TV weatherman, along with his attractive-but-distant producer, and his mawkish cameraman, is sent to report on Groundhog Day in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself repeating the same day over and over. 
Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson validates a recently founded Groundhog Day reference in his 2016 Marvel film. James Gunn may be the king of Marvel easter eggs, but acclaimed horror filmmaker may give the Guardians of the Galaxy director a run for his money in hiding fun callbacks. 
Ever wonder how many days Phil spends in the time loop? In this episode, I discuss the movie "Groundhog Day" (1993) with Bill Murray. If you have any recomme 
"Groundhog Day" is basically a movie about a self-obsessed stalker taking 200 days to figure out what the woman he's after actually likes and using that info to get her. Until it's not. Because Phil does get his girl, but that isn't good enough, so the day keeps resetting. 
Groundhog Day. Edit. Bill Murray was bitten by the groundhog twice during shooting. Murray had to have anti rabies injections, because the bites were so severe. 
The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58 </p>
