Prior to 2024, the groundhog had seen his shadow 107 times and not seen his shadow 20 times, according to the York Daily Record, part of the USA TODAY Network. There were a few years in the late  
USA TODAY provided live coverage of Groundhog Day events from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, which started after 6 a.m. ET, where Punxsutawney Phil made his prediction. 
"Today the Germans say the groundhog comes out of his winter quarters," read the diary entry, "and if he sees his shadow he returns in and remains there 40 days."

The annual event dates to 1887 when a group of groundhog hunters first dubbed themselves "The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club" and proclaimed Punxsutawney Phil to be the one-and-only weather  
The day eventually evolved into what we know it today. In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local newspaper, Weathers Wags, according to the club. 
Groundhog Day 2024 is here and Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow, predicting an early spring. According to the Stormfax Almanac, though, Phil has only predicted correctly 39% of the time  
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
To which Phil responses "Not today." The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment. 
When you look at Woodstock's town square today, it looks almost the same as when the movie "Groundhog Day" was being shot. Except there are now more businesses open than back in 1992. 
The city of Woodstock, Illinois, is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the classic Bill Murray comedy “Groundhog Day” which was filmed in the small town that is proud of its place in  
To me, every day of this pandemic has felt likeGroundhog Day. I get up, I write some articles, I work on my script, I wander my neighborhood, and I go to bed doing the same thing again and again and again. Still, it's hard to think about a movie as culturally significant as Groundhog Day. It created a whole genre of comedy where people relive  
Groundhog Day the movie came out in February 1993, which means, we assume, that the Groundhog Day Phil Connors experienced happened on February 2, 1993.  (The presidential inauguration happened  
So in each of these days, some with levity, and some with darker moments of Phil actually taking his own life, his news crew and people of the town would just assume that that day happened exactly as it did, and they were totally unaware that they were now part of a new timeline. 
The clever ads, which are airing all day on ABC on Feb. 2, show Stephen Tobolowsky, who appeared in the 1993 comedy alongside Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, going through a supermarket checkout  
In the 1993 film Groundhog Day, Phil Connors lives through the same day again and again and again and againfor years.After an initial shock, he realizes that this is a great oppportunity for  
A 2005 surgery to extract dead and damaged brain cells improved her lot — the seizures largely stopped. But Philpots still faces waking up each day having to fill in the last 16 years of her life.
