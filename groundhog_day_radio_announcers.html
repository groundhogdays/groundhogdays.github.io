Groundhog Day Announcer: Placing Phil on top of the stump where in Groundhogese, he directed the president, Jeff Lundy, and the inner circle to his prediction scroll that reads, with my shadow I have cast, that a long lustrous six more weeks of winter.

Experience this timeless story where it all began — Woodstock, IL, the iconic filming location of Groundhog Day. Don’t miss this special production at  
The next morning Phil is woken by the clock radio. He feels something is wrong (18:21): The radio announcers are repeating what they had said yesterday like a recorder. And everybody stands in the exact same spot they were in the day before, talking about Groundhog Day again. Phil asks them what day it is.

Happy Groundhog Day, everyone! Obviously today everyone's mind is on the 1993 Bill Murray classic Groundhog Day.
