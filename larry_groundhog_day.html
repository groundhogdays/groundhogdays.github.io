        <p>Chris Elliott is a comedian and actor who appeared in many movies and TV shows, including Groundhog Day. Learn about his career, roles, and how he became the mayor of Schitt's Creek. 
With the big day (February 2nd) nearly upon us, I thought I would use the opportunity to examine the Small Moment that really stood out to me on a recent revisit of Groundhog Day. It is the moment that, for me, answers the question of what the film is about: what its protagonist really learns, and what we as viewers can learn from it. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

On February 1, self-centered and sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray), news producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog. 
Eugene McCoy is a British actor. He originated the role of Larry, doubling as an ensemble member, as part of the London cast of Groundhog Day. 
Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time. In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie. 
The scene where Larry (Chris Elliott) drops a 2 buck tip, and picks the second dollar back up when Nancy isn't looking. 
Feb 3 Larry has a memory only of the last loop of Groundhog Day, and also a memory of Feb 1. Thus the Larry of the last Groundhog Day is in memory continuity with Larry before and after that day, and so these Larrys are memory-theory identical. The Larrys of all the other Days are left out in the cold, identity-wise. 
Starring Bill Murray as a grouchy, smug Pittsburgh weatherman who longs for a major-market job, annoyed that he has to truck on over to Punxsutawney to attend their lame Groundhog Day ceremony once again, the film also featured Andie MacDowell as his lighthearted producer Rita and Chris Elliott as the vaguely creepy cameraman Larry.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating
